/**
 * This is an API for scheduling various types of jobs against the framework that will be executed
 * in your application's own process.
 * <p>
 * See {@link android.app.job.JobInfo} for more description of the types of jobs that can be run
 * and how to construct them. You will construct these JobInfo objects and pass them to the
 * JobScheduler with {@link #schedule(JobInfo)}. When the criteria declared are met, the
 * system will execute this job on your application's {@link android.app.job.JobService}.
 * You identify the service component that implements the logic for your job when you
 * construct the JobInfo using
 * {@link android.app.job.JobInfo.Builder#Builder(int,android.content.ComponentName)}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The framework will be intelligent about when it executes jobs, and attempt to batch
 * and defer them as much as possible. Typically, if you don't specify a deadline on a job, it
 * can be run at any moment depending on the current state of the JobScheduler's internal queue.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Starting in Android version {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#UPSIDE_DOWN_CAKE},
 * JobScheduler may try to optimize job execution by shifting execution to times with more available
 * system resources in order to lower user impact. Factors in system health include sufficient
 * battery, idle, charging, and access to an un-metered network. Jobs will initially be treated as
 * if they have all these requirements, but as their deadlines approach, restrictions will become
 * less strict. Requested requirements will not be affected by this change.
 * </p>
 *
 * {@see android.app.job.JobInfo.Builder#setRequiresBatteryNotLow(boolean)}
 * {@see android.app.job.JobInfo.Builder#setRequiresDeviceIdle(boolean)}
 * {@see android.app.job.JobInfo.Builder#setRequiresCharging(boolean)}
 * {@see android.app.job.JobInfo.Builder#setRequiredNetworkType(int)}
 *
 * <p>
 * While a job is running, the system holds a wakelock on behalf of your app.  For this reason,
 * you do not need to take any action to guarantee that the device stays awake for the
 * duration of the job.
 * </p>
 * <p>You do not
 * instantiate this class directly; instead, retrieve it through
 * {@link android.content.Context#getSystemService
 * Context.getSystemService(Context.JOB_SCHEDULER_SERVICE)}.
 *
 * <p> Prior to Android version {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#S}, jobs could only have
 * a maximum of 100 jobs scheduled at a time. Starting with Android version
 * {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#S}, that limit has been increased to 150.
 * Expedited jobs also count towards the limit.
 *
 * <p> In Android version {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#LOLLIPOP}, jobs had a maximum
 * execution time of one minute. Starting with Android version
 * {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#M} and ending with Android version
 * {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#R}, jobs had a maximum execution time of 10 minutes.
 * Starting from Android version {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#S}, jobs will still be
 * stopped after 10 minutes if the system is busy or needs the resources, but if not, jobs
 * may continue running longer than 10 minutes.
 *
 * <p class="caution"><strong>Note:</strong> Beginning with API 30
 * ({@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#R}), JobScheduler will throttle runaway applications.
 * Calling {@link #schedule(JobInfo)} and other such methods with very high frequency can have a
 * high cost and so, to make sure the system doesn't get overwhelmed, JobScheduler will begin
 * to throttle apps, regardless of target SDK version.
