    Vendor-provided fallback fonts

    This file can be edited to add references to fonts that are not installed or referenced in the
    default system. The file should then be placed in /vendor/etc/fallback_fonts.xml. Note
    that in your makefile, this directory should be referenced as $(TARGET_COPY_OUT_VENDOR)/etc/:

        PRODUCT_COPY_FILES += \
            frameworks/base/data/fonts/vendor_fonts.xml:$(TARGET_COPY_OUT_VENDOR)/etc/fallback_fonts.xml \
            frameworks/base/data/fonts/vendor_fonts-ja.xml:$(TARGET_COPY_OUT_VENDOR)/etc/fallback_fonts-ja.xml

    For example, vendors might want to build configurations for locales that are
    better served by fonts which either handle glyphs not supported in the default fonts or which
    handle these glyphs differently than the default fallback fonts.
    Each entry in this list is a "family", which consists of a list of "files"
    (the filenames for that family). The files objects are
    provided in the order of the styles supported for that family: regular, bold, italic, and
    bold-italic. Only providing one font means that all styles will be rendered with that font.
    Providing two means that these two fonts will render regular and bold fonts (italics will
    be mapped to these two fonts).

    There is also an optional "order" attribute on the Family tag. This specifies the index at
    which that family of fonts should be inserted in the fallback font list, where the
    default fallback fonts on the system (in /system/etc/fallback_fonts.xml) start at index 0.
    If no 'order' attribute is supplied, that family will be inserted either at the end of the
    current fallback list (if no order was supplied for any previous family in this file) or
    after the previous family (if there was an order specified previously). Typically, vendors
    may want to supply an order for the first family that puts this set of fonts at the appropriate
    place in the overall fallback fonts. The order of this list determines which fallback font
    will be used to support any glyphs that are not handled by the default system fonts.

    Han languages (Chinese, Japanese, and Korean) share a common range of unicode characters;
    their ordering in the fallback or vendor files gives priority to the first in the list.
    Locale-specific ordering can be configured by adding language and region codes to the end
    of the filename (e.g. /vendor/etc/fallback_fonts-ja.xml). When no region code is used,
    as with this example, all regions are matched. Use separate files for each supported locale.
    The standard fallback file (fallback_fonts.xml) is used when a locale does not have its own
    file. All fallback files must contain the same complete set of fonts; only their ordering
    can differ. For example, on a device supporting Japanese, but with English as the default,
    /vendor/etc/fallback_fonts.xml might contain:

        <familyset>
            <family>
                <fileset>
                    <file>DroidSansJapanese.ttf</file>
                </fileset>
            </family>
        </familyset>

    placing the Japanese font at the end of the fallback sequence for English, with a corresponding
    /system/vendor/etc/fallback_fonts-ja.xml, placing it at the front of the list.

        <familyset>
            <family order="0">
                <fileset>
                    <file>DroidSansJapanese.ttf</file>
                </fileset>
            </family>
        </familyset>

    The sample configuration below is an example of how one might provide two families of fonts
    that get inserted at the first and second (0  and 1) position in the overall fallback fonts.

    See /system/etc/system_fonts.xml and /system/etc/fallback_fonts.xml for more information
    and to understand the order in which the default system fonts are loaded and structured for
    lookup.
