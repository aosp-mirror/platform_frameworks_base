/**
 * Helper class for calling into PackageManagerInternal.setPackagesSuspendedByAdmin.
 * Two main things this class encapsulates:
 *    1. Handling of the DPM internal suspension exemption list
 *    2. Calculating the failed packages result in the context of coexistence
 *
 * 1 is handled by the two internal methods {@link #suspendWithExemption(Set)} and
 * {@link #unsuspendWithExemption(Set)} where the exemption list is taken into consideration
 * before and after calling {@link PackageManagerInternal#setPackagesSuspendedByAdmin}.
 * In order to compute 2, the resolved package suspension state before and after suspension is
 * needed as multiple admins can both suspend the same packages under coexistence.
