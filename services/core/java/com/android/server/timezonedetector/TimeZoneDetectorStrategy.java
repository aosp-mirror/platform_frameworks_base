/**
 * The interface for the class that is responsible for setting the time zone on a device, used by
 * {@link TimeZoneDetectorService} and {@link TimeZoneDetectorInternal}.
 *
 * <p>The strategy receives suggestions, which it may use to modify the device's time zone setting.
 * Suggestions are acted on or ignored as needed, depending on previously received suggestions and
 * the current user's configuration (see {@link ConfigurationInternal}).
 *
 * <p>Devices can have zero, one or two automatic time zone detection algorithms available at any
 * point in time.
 *
 * <p>The two automatic detection algorithms supported are "telephony" and "location". Algorithm
 * availability and use depends on several factors:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Telephony is only available on devices with a telephony stack.
 * <li>Location is also optional and configured at image creation time. When enabled on a device,
 * its availability depends on the current user's settings, so switching between users can change
 * the automatic detection algorithm used by the device.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>If there are no automatic time zone detections algorithms available then the user can usually
 * change the device time zone manually. Under most circumstances the current user can turn
 * automatic time zone detection on or off, or choose the algorithm via settings.
 *
 * <p>Telephony detection is independent of the current user. The device keeps track of the most
 * recent telephony suggestion from each slotIndex. When telephony detection is in use, the highest
 * scoring suggestion is used to set the device time zone based on a scoring algorithm. If several
 * slotIndexes provide the same score then the slotIndex with the lowest numeric value "wins". If
 * the situation changes and it is no longer possible to be confident about the time zone,
 * slotIndexes must have an empty suggestion submitted in order to "withdraw" their previous
 * suggestion otherwise it will remain in use.
 *
 * <p>Location-based detection is dependent on the current user and their settings. The device
 * retains at most one geolocation suggestion. Generally, use of a device's location is dependent on
 * the user's "location toggle", but even when that is enabled the user may choose to enable /
 * disable the use of location for device time zone detection. If the current user changes to one
 * that does not have location-based detection enabled, or the user turns off the location-based
 * detection, then the strategy will be sent an event that clears the latest suggestion. Devices
 * that lose their location fix must have an empty suggestion submitted in order to "withdraw" their
 * previous suggestion otherwise it will remain in use.
 *
 * <p>The strategy uses only one algorithm at a time and does not attempt consensus even when
 * more than one is available on a device. This "use only one" behavior is deliberate as different
 * algorithms have edge cases and blind spots that lead to incorrect answers or uncertainty;
 * different algorithms aren't guaranteed to agree, and algorithms may frequently lose certainty as
 * users enter areas without the necessary signals. Ultimately, with no perfect algorithm available,
 * the user is left to choose which algorithm works best for their circumstances.
 *
 * <p>When the location detection algorithm is supported and enabled, in certain circumstances, such
 * as during international travel, it makes sense to prioritize speed of detection via telephony
 * (when available) Vs waiting for the location-based detection algorithm to reach certainty.
 * Location-based detection can sometimes be slow to get a location fix and can require network
 * connectivity (which cannot be assumed when users are travelling) for server-assisted location
 * detection or time zone lookup. Therefore, as a restricted form of prioritization between location
 * and telephony algorithms, the strategy provides "telephony fallback mode" behavior, which can be
 * set to "supported" via device config. Fallback mode is entered at runtime in response to signals
 * from outside of the strategy, e.g. from a call to {@link
 * #enableTelephonyTimeZoneFallback(String)}, or from information in the latest {@link
 * LocationAlgorithmEvent}. For telephony fallback mode to actually use a telephony suggestion, the
 * location algorithm <em>must</em> report it is uncertain. Telephony fallback allows the use of
 * telephony suggestions to help with faster detection but only until the location algorithm
 * provides a concrete, "certain" suggestion. After the location algorithm has made a certain
 * suggestion, telephony fallback mode is disabled.
 *
 * <p>Threading:
 *
 * <p>Implementations of this class must be thread-safe as calls calls like {@link
 * #generateMetricsState()} and {@link #dump(IndentingPrintWriter, String[])} may be called on
 * different threads concurrently with other operations.
