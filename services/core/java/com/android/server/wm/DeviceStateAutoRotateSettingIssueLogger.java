/**
 * Logs potential race conditions that lead to incorrect auto-rotate setting.
 *
 * Before go/auto-rotate-refactor, there is a race condition that happen during device state
 * changes, as a result, incorrect auto-rotate setting are written for a device state in
 * DEVICE_STATE_ROTATION_LOCK. Realistically, users shouldnâ€™t be able to change
 * DEVICE_STATE_ROTATION_LOCK while the device folds/unfolds.
 *
 * This class monitors the time between a device state change and a subsequent change to the device
 * state based auto-rotate setting.  If the duration is less than a threshold
 * (DEVICE_STATE_AUTO_ROTATE_SETTING_ISSUE_THRESHOLD), a potential issue is logged. The logging of
 * the atom is not expected to occur often, realistically estimated once a month on few devices.
 * But the number could be bigger, as that's what this metric is set to reveal.
