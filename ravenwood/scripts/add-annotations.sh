# Use "ravehleper mm" to create a shell script which:
# - Reads read a list of methods from STDIN
#   Which basically looks like a list of 'com.android.ravenwoodtest.tests.Test1#testA'
# - Add @DisabledOnRavenwood to them
#
# Example usage:
#
# ./add-annotations.sh $ANDROID_BUILD_TOP/frameworks/base/ravenwood/tests <METHOD-LIST.txt
#
# Use a different annotation instead. (Note, in order to use an at, you need to use a double-at.)
# ./add-annotations.sh -t '@@Ignore' $ANDROID_BUILD_TOP/frameworks/base/ravenwood/tests <METHOD-LIST.txt
#

set -e

# Uncomment it to always build ravenhelper (slow)
# ${BUILD_CMD:-m} ravenhelper

# We add this line to each methods found.
# Note, if we used a single @, that'd be handled as an at file. Use
# the double-at instead.
