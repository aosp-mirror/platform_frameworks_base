<p>The Android framework provides plenty of standard tools for creating attractive, functional
graphical user interfaces. However, if you want more control of what your application draws on
screen, or are venturing into three dimensional graphics, you need to use a different tool. The
OpenGL ES APIs provided by the Android framework offers a set of tools for displaying high-end,
animated graphics that are limited only by your imagination and can also benefit from the
acceleration of graphics processing units (GPUs) provided on many Android devices.</p>

<p>This class walks you through the basics of developing applications that use OpenGL, including
setup, drawing objects, moving drawn elements and responding to touch input.</p>

<p>The example code in this class uses the OpenGL ES 2.0 APIs, which is the recommended API version
to use with current Android devices. For more information about versions of OpenGL ES, see the <a
href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/graphics/opengl.html#choosing-version">OpenGL</a>
developer guide.</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Be careful not to mix OpenGL ES 1.x API calls with OpenGL
ES 2.0 methods! The two APIs are not interchangeable and trying to use them together only results in
frustration and sadness.</p>
