<p>This lesson describes how to track movement in touch events.</p>

<p>A new {@link
android.view.View#onTouchEvent onTouchEvent()} is triggered with an {@link
android.view.MotionEvent#ACTION_MOVE} event whenever the current touch contact
position, pressure, or size changes. As described in <a
href="detector.html">Detecting Common Gestures</a>, all of these events are
recorded in the {@link android.view.MotionEvent} parameter of {@link
android.view.View#onTouchEvent onTouchEvent()}.</p>

<p>Because finger-based touch isn't always the most precise form of interaction,
detecting touch events is often based more on movement than on simple contact.
To help apps distinguish between movement-based gestures (such as a swipe) and
non-movement gestures (such as a single tap), Android includes the notion of
"touch slop." Touch slop refers to the distance in pixels a user's touch can wander
before the gesture is interpreted as a movement-based gesture. For more discussion of this 
topic, see <a href="viewgroup.html#vc">Managing Touch Events in a ViewGroup</a>.</p>



<p>There are several different ways to track movement in a gesture, depending on
the needs of your application. For example:</p> 

<ul>

<li>The starting and ending position of a pointer (for example, move an
on-screen object from point A to point B).</li>

<li>The direction the pointer is traveling in, as determined by the x and y coordinates.</li>

<li>History. You can find the size of a gesture's history by calling the {@link
android.view.MotionEvent} method {@link android.view.MotionEvent#getHistorySize
getHistorySize()}. You can then obtain the positions, sizes, time, and pressures
of each of the historical events by using the motion event's {@code
getHistorical<em>&lt;Value&gt;</em>} methods. History is useful when rendering a trail of the user's finger, 
such as for touch drawing. See the {@link android.view.MotionEvent} reference for
details.</li>

<li>The velocity of the pointer as it moves across the touch screen.</li>

</ul>



<h2 id="velocity">Track Velocity</h2>

<p> You could have a movement-based gesture that is simply based on the distance and/or direction the pointer traveled. But velocity often is a
determining factor in tracking a gesture's characteristics or even deciding
whether the gesture occurred. To make velocity calculation easier, Android
provides the {@link android.view.VelocityTracker} class and the  	
{@link android.support.v4.view.VelocityTrackerCompat} class in the 
<a href="{@docRoot}tools/extras/support-library.html">Support Library</a>.
{@link
android.view.VelocityTracker} helps you track the velocity of touch events. This
is useful for gestures in which velocity is part of the criteria for the
gesture, such as a fling.</p>


<p>Here is a simple example that illustrates the purpose of the methods in the 
{@link android.view.VelocityTracker} API:</p>

<pre>public class MainActivity extends Activity {
    private static final String DEBUG_TAG = "Velocity";
        ...
    private VelocityTracker mVelocityTracker = null;
    &#64;Override
    public boolean onTouchEvent(MotionEvent event) {
        int index = event.getActionIndex();
        int action = event.getActionMasked();
        int pointerId = event.getPointerId(index);

        switch(action) {
            case MotionEvent.ACTION_DOWN:
                if(mVelocityTracker == null) {
                    // Retrieve a new VelocityTracker object to watch the velocity of a motion.
                    mVelocityTracker = VelocityTracker.obtain();
                }
                else {
                    // Reset the velocity tracker back to its initial state.
                    mVelocityTracker.clear();
                }
                // Add a user's movement to the tracker.
                mVelocityTracker.addMovement(event);
                break;
            case MotionEvent.ACTION_MOVE:
                mVelocityTracker.addMovement(event);
                // When you want to determine the velocity, call 
                // computeCurrentVelocity(). Then call getXVelocity() 
                // and getYVelocity() to retrieve the velocity for each pointer ID. 
                mVelocityTracker.computeCurrentVelocity(1000);
                // Log velocity of pixels per second
                // Best practice to use VelocityTrackerCompat where possible.
                Log.d("", "X velocity: " + 
                        VelocityTrackerCompat.getXVelocity(mVelocityTracker, 
                        pointerId));
                Log.d("", "Y velocity: " + 
                        VelocityTrackerCompat.getYVelocity(mVelocityTracker,
                        pointerId));
                break;
            case MotionEvent.ACTION_UP:
            case MotionEvent.ACTION_CANCEL:
                // Return a VelocityTracker object back to be re-used by others.
                mVelocityTracker.recycle();
                break;
        }
        return true;
    }
}
</pre>

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Note that you should calculate velocity after an 
{@link android.view.MotionEvent#ACTION_MOVE} event, 
not after {@link android.view.MotionEvent#ACTION_UP}. After an {@link android.view.MotionEvent#ACTION_UP}, 
the X and Y velocities will be 0.
