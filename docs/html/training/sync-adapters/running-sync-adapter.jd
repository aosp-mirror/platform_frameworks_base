    In the previous lessons in this class, you learned how to create a sync adapter component that
    encapsulates data transfer code, and how to add the additional components that allow you to
    plug the sync adapter into the system. You now have everything you need to install an app that
    includes a sync adapter, but none of the code you've seen actually runs the sync adapter.
</p>
<p>
    You should try to run your sync adapter based on a schedule or as the indirect result of some
    event. For example, you may want your sync adapter to run on a regular schedule, either after a
    certain period of time or at a particular time of the day. You may also want to run your sync
    adapter when there are changes to data stored on the device. You should avoid running your
    sync adapter as the direct result of a user action, because by doing this you don't get the full
    benefit of the sync adapter framework's scheduling ability. For example, you should avoid
    providing a refresh button in your user interface.
</p>
<p>
    You have the following options for running your sync adapter:
</p>
<dl>
    <dt>
        When server data changes
    </dt>
    <dd>
        Run the sync adapter in response to a message from a server, indicating that server-based
        data has changed. This option allows you to refresh data from the server to the device
        without degrading performance or wasting battery life by polling the server.
    </dd>
    <dt>When device data changes</dt>
    <dd>
        Run a sync adapter when data changes on the device. This option allows you to send
        modified data from the device to a server, and is especially useful if you need to ensure
        that the server always has the latest device data. This option is straightforward to
        implement if you actually store data in your content provider. If you're using a stub
        content provider, detecting data changes may be more difficult.
    </dd>
    <dt>
        When the system sends out a network message
    </dt>
    <dd>
        Run a sync adapter when the Android system sends out a network message that keeps the
        TCP/IP connection open; this message is a basic part of the networking framework. Using
        this option is one way to run the sync adapter automatically. Consider using it in
        conjunction with interval-based sync adapter runs.
    </dd>
    <dt>
        At regular intervals
    </dt>
    <dd>
        Run a sync adapter after the expiration of an interval you choose, or run it at a certain
        time every day.
    </dd>
    <dt>On demand</dt>
    <dd>
        Run the sync adapter in response to a user action. However, to provide the best user
        experience you should rely primarily on one of the more automated options. By using
        automated options, you conserve battery and network resources.
    </dd>
</dl>
<p>
    The rest of this lesson describes each of the options in more detail.
</p>
<h2 id="RunByMessage">Run the Sync Adapter When Server Data Changes</h2>
<p>
    If your app transfers data from a server and the server data changes frequently, you can use
    a sync adapter to do downloads in response to data changes. To run the sync adapter, have
    the server send a special message to a {@link android.content.BroadcastReceiver} in your app.
    In response to this message, call {@link android.content.ContentResolver#requestSync
    ContentResolver.requestSync()} to signal the sync adapter framework to run your
    sync adapter.
</p>
<p>
    <a href="{@docRoot}google/gcm/index.html">Google Cloud Messaging</a> (GCM) provides both the
    server and device components you need to make this messaging system work. Using GCM to trigger
    transfers is more reliable and more efficient than polling servers for status. While polling
    requires a {@link android.app.Service} that is always active, GCM uses a
    {@link android.content.BroadcastReceiver} that's activated when a message arrives. While polling
    at regular intervals uses battery power even if no updates are available, GCM only sends
    messages when needed.
</p>
<p class="note">
    <strong>Note:</strong> If you use GCM to trigger your sync adapter via a broadcast to all
    devices where your app is installed, remember that they receive your message at
    roughly the same time. This situation can cause multiple instance of your sync adapter to run
    at the same time, causing server and network overload. To avoid this situation for a broadcast
    to all devices, you should consider deferring the start of the sync adapter for a period
    that's unique for each device.
<p>
    The following code snippet shows you how to run
    {@link android.content.ContentResolver#requestSync requestSync()} in response to an
    incoming GCM message:
</p>
<pre>
public class GcmBroadcastReceiver extends BroadcastReceiver {
    ...
    // Constants
    // Content provider authority
    public static final String AUTHORITY = "com.example.android.datasync.provider"
    // Account type
    public static final String ACCOUNT_TYPE = "com.example.android.datasync";
    // Account
    public static final String ACCOUNT = "default_account";
    // Incoming Intent key for extended data
    public static final String KEY_SYNC_REQUEST =
            "com.example.android.datasync.KEY_SYNC_REQUEST";
    ...
    &#64;Override
    public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {
        // Get a GCM object instance
        GoogleCloudMessaging gcm =
                GoogleCloudMessaging.getInstance(context);
        // Get the type of GCM message
        String messageType = gcm.getMessageType(intent);
        /*
         * Test the message type and examine the message contents.
         * Since GCM is a general-purpose messaging system, you
         * may receive normal messages that don't require a sync
         * adapter run.
         * The following code tests for a a boolean flag indicating
         * that the message is requesting a transfer from the device.
         */
        if (GoogleCloudMessaging.MESSAGE_TYPE_MESSAGE.equals(messageType)
            &amp;&amp;
            intent.getBooleanExtra(KEY_SYNC_REQUEST)) {
            /*
             * Signal the framework to run your sync adapter. Assume that
             * app initialization has already created the account.
             */
            ContentResolver.requestSync(ACCOUNT, AUTHORITY, null);
            ...
        }
        ...
    }
    ...
}
</pre>
<h2 id="RunDataChange">Run the Sync Adapter When Content Provider Data Changes</h2>
<p>
    If your app collects data in a content provider, and you want to update the server whenever
    you update the provider, you can set up your app to run your sync adapter automatically. To do
    this, you register an observer for the content provider. When data in your content provider
    changes, the content provider framework calls the observer. In the observer, call
    {@link android.content.ContentResolver#requestSync requestSync()} to tell the framework to run
    your sync adapter.
</p>
<p class="note">
    <strong>Note:</strong> If you're using a stub content provider, you don't have any data in
    the content provider and {@link android.database.ContentObserver#onChange onChange()} is
    never called. In this case, you have to provide your own mechanism for detecting changes to
    device data. This mechanism is also responsible for calling
    {@link android.content.ContentResolver#requestSync requestSync()} when the data changes.
</p>
<p>
   To create an observer for your content provider, extend the class
   {@link android.database.ContentObserver} and implement both forms of its
   {@link android.database.ContentObserver#onChange onChange()} method.  In
   {@link android.database.ContentObserver#onChange onChange()}, call
   {@link android.content.ContentResolver#requestSync requestSync()} to start the sync adapter.
</p>
<p>
   To register the observer, pass it as an argument in a call to
   {@link android.content.ContentResolver#registerContentObserver registerContentObserver()}. In
   this call, you also have to pass in a content URI for the data you want to watch. The content
   provider framework compares this watch URI to content URIs passed in as arguments to
   {@link android.content.ContentResolver} methods that modify your provider, such as
   {@link android.content.ContentResolver#insert ContentResolver.insert()}. If there's a match, your
   implementation of {@link android.database.ContentObserver#onChange ContentObserver.onChange()}
   is called.
</p>

<p>
    The following code snippet shows you how to define a {@link android.database.ContentObserver}
    that calls {@link android.content.ContentResolver#requestSync requestSync()} when a table
    changes:
</p>
<pre>
public class MainActivity extends FragmentActivity {
    ...
    // Constants
    // Content provider scheme
    public static final String SCHEME = "content://";
    // Content provider authority
    public static final String AUTHORITY = "com.example.android.datasync.provider";
    // Path for the content provider table
    public static final String TABLE_PATH = "data_table";
    // Account
    public static final String ACCOUNT = "default_account";
    // Global variables
    // A content URI for the content provider's data table
    Uri mUri;
    // A content resolver for accessing the provider
    ContentResolver mResolver;
    ...
    public class TableObserver extends ContentObserver {
        /*
         * Define a method that's called when data in the
         * observed content provider changes.
         * This method signature is provided for compatibility with
         * older platforms.
         */
        &#64;Override
        public void onChange(boolean selfChange) {
            /*
             * Invoke the method signature available as of
             * Android platform version 4.1, with a null URI.
             */
            onChange(selfChange, null);
        }
        /*
         * Define a method that's called when data in the
         * observed content provider changes.
         */
        &#64;Override
        public void onChange(boolean selfChange, Uri changeUri) {
            /*
             * Ask the framework to run your sync adapter.
             * To maintain backward compatibility, assume that
             * changeUri is null.
            ContentResolver.requestSync(ACCOUNT, AUTHORITY, null);
        }
        ...
    }
    ...
    &#64;Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        ...
        // Get the content resolver object for your app
        mResolver = getContentResolver();
        // Construct a URI that points to the content provider data table
        mUri = new Uri.Builder()
                  .scheme(SCHEME)
                  .authority(AUTHORITY)
                  .path(TABLE_PATH)
                  .build();
        /*
         * Create a content observer object.
         * Its code does not mutate the provider, so set
         * selfChange to "false"
         */
        TableObserver observer = new TableObserver(false);
        /*
         * Register the observer for the data table. The table's path
         * and any of its subpaths trigger the observer.
         */
        mResolver.registerContentObserver(mUri, true, observer);
        ...
    }
    ...
}
</pre>
<h2 id="RunByNetwork">Run the Sync Adapter After a Network Message</h2>
<p>
    When a network connection is available, the Android system sends out a message
    every few seconds to keep the device's TCP/IP connection open. This message also goes to
    the {@link android.content.ContentResolver} of each app. By calling
    {@link android.content.ContentResolver#setSyncAutomatically setSyncAutomatically()},
    you can run the sync adapter whenever the {@link android.content.ContentResolver}
    receives the message.
</p>
<p>
    By scheduling your sync adapter to run when the network message is sent, you ensure that your
    sync adapter is always scheduled to run while the network is available. Use this option if you
    don't have to force a data transfer in response to data changes, but you do want to ensure
    your data is regularly updated. Similarly, you can use this option if you don't want a fixed
    schedule for your sync adapter, but you do want it to run frequently.
</p>
<p>
    Since the method
    {@link android.content.ContentResolver#setSyncAutomatically setSyncAutomatically()}
    doesn't disable {@link android.content.ContentResolver#addPeriodicSync addPeriodicSync()}, your
    sync adapter may be triggered repeatedly in a short period of time. If you do want to run
    your sync adapter periodically on a regular schedule, you should disable
    {@link android.content.ContentResolver#setSyncAutomatically setSyncAutomatically()}.
</p>
<p>
    The following code snippet shows you how to configure your
    {@link android.content.ContentResolver} to run your sync adapter in response to a network
    message:
</p>
<pre>
public class MainActivity extends FragmentActivity {
    ...
    // Constants
    // Content provider authority
    public static final String AUTHORITY = "com.example.android.datasync.provider";
    // Account
    public static final String ACCOUNT = "default_account";
    // Global variables
    // A content resolver for accessing the provider
    ContentResolver mResolver;
    ...
    &#64;Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        ...
        // Get the content resolver for your app
        mResolver = getContentResolver();
        // Turn on automatic syncing for the default account and authority
        mResolver.setSyncAutomatically(ACCOUNT, AUTHORITY, true);
        ...
    }
    ...
}
</pre>
<h2 id="RunPeriodic">Run the Sync Adapter Periodically</h2>
<p>
    You can run your sync adapter periodically by setting a period of time to wait between runs,
    or by running it at certain times of the day, or both. Running your sync adapter
    periodically allows you to roughly match the update interval of your server.
</p>
<p>
    Similarly, you can upload data from the device when your server is relatively idle, by
    scheduling your sync adapter to run at night. Most users leave their powered on and plugged in
    at night, so this time is usually available. Moreover, the device is not running other tasks at
    the same time as your sync adapter. If you take this approach, however, you need to ensure that
    each device triggers a data transfer at a slightly different time. If all devices run your
    sync adapter at the same time, you are likely to overload your server and cell provider data
    networks.
</p>
<p>
    In general, periodic runs make sense if your users don't need instant updates, but expect to
    have regular updates. Periodic runs also make sense if you want to balance the availability of
    up-to-date data with the efficiency of smaller sync adapter runs that don't over-use device
    resources.
</p>
<p>
    To run your sync adapter at regular intervals, call
    {@link android.content.ContentResolver#addPeriodicSync addPeriodicSync()}. This schedules your
    sync adapter to run after a certain amount of time has elapsed. Since the sync adapter framework
    has to account for other sync adapter executions and tries to maximize battery efficiency, the
    elapsed time may vary by a few seconds. Also, the framework won't run your sync adapter if the
    network is not available.
</p>
<p>
    Notice that {@link android.content.ContentResolver#addPeriodicSync addPeriodicSync()} doesn't
    run the sync adapter at a particular time of day. To run your sync adapter at roughly the
    same time every day, use a repeating alarm as a trigger. Repeating alarms are described in more
    detail in the reference documentation for {@link android.app.AlarmManager}. If you use the
    method {@link android.app.AlarmManager#setInexactRepeating setInexactRepeating()} to set
    time-of-day triggers that have some variation, you should still randomize the start time to
    ensure that sync adapter runs from different devices are staggered.
</p>
<p>
    The method {@link android.content.ContentResolver#addPeriodicSync addPeriodicSync()} doesn't
    disable {@link android.content.ContentResolver#setSyncAutomatically setSyncAutomatically()},
    so you may get multiple sync runs in a relatively short period of time. Also, only a few
    sync adapter control flags are allowed in a call to
    {@link android.content.ContentResolver#addPeriodicSync addPeriodicSync()}; the flags that are
    not allowed are described in the referenced documentation for
    {@link android.content.ContentResolver#addPeriodicSync addPeriodicSync()}.
</p>
<p>
    The following code snippet shows you how to schedule periodic sync adapter runs:
</p>
<pre>
public class MainActivity extends FragmentActivity {
    ...
    // Constants
    // Content provider authority
    public static final String AUTHORITY = "com.example.android.datasync.provider";
    // Account
    public static final String ACCOUNT = "default_account";
    // Sync interval constants
    public static final long SECONDS_PER_MINUTE = 60L;
    public static final long SYNC_INTERVAL_IN_MINUTES = 60L;
    public static final long SYNC_INTERVAL =
            SYNC_INTERVAL_IN_MINUTES *
            SECONDS_PER_MINUTE;
    // Global variables
    // A content resolver for accessing the provider
    ContentResolver mResolver;
    ...
    &#64;Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        ...
        // Get the content resolver for your app
        mResolver = getContentResolver();
        /*
         * Turn on periodic syncing
         */
        ContentResolver.addPeriodicSync(
                ACCOUNT,
                AUTHORITY,
                Bundle.EMPTY,
                SYNC_INTERVAL);
        ...
    }
    ...
}
</pre>
<h2 id="RunOnDemand">Run the Sync Adapter On Demand</h2>
<p>
    Running your sync adapter in response to a user request is the least preferable strategy
    for running a sync adapter. The framework is specifically designed to conserve battery power
    when it runs sync adapters according to a schedule. Options that run a sync in response to data
    changes use battery power effectively, since the power is used to provide new data.
</p>
<p>
    In comparison, allowing users to run a sync on demand means that the sync runs by itself, which
    is inefficient use of network and power resources. Also, providing sync on demand leads users to
    request a sync even if there's no evidence that the data has changed, and running a sync that
    doesn't refresh data is an ineffective use of battery power. In general, your app should either
    use other signals to trigger a sync or schedule them at regular intervals, without user input.
</p>
<p>
    However, if you still want to run the sync adapter on demand, set the sync adapter flags for a
    manual sync adapter run, then call
    {@link android.content.ContentResolver#requestSync ContentResolver.requestSync()}.
</p>
<p>
    Run on demand transfers with the following flags:
</p>
<dl>
    <dt>
        {@link android.content.ContentResolver#SYNC_EXTRAS_MANUAL SYNC_EXTRAS_MANUAL}
    </dt>
    <dd>
        Forces a manual sync. The sync adapter framework ignores the existing settings,
        such as the flag set by {@link android.content.ContentResolver#setSyncAutomatically
        setSyncAutomatically()}.
    </dd>
    <dt>
        {@link android.content.ContentResolver#SYNC_EXTRAS_EXPEDITED SYNC_EXTRAS_EXPEDITED}
    </dt>
    <dd>
        Forces the sync to start immediately. If you don't set this, the system may wait several
        seconds before running the sync request, because it tries to optimize battery use by
        scheduling many requests in a short period of time.
    </dd>
</dl>
<p>
    The following code snippet shows you how to call
    {@link android.content.ContentResolver#requestSync requestSync()} in response to a button
    click:
</p>
<pre>
public class MainActivity extends FragmentActivity {
    ...
    // Constants
    // Content provider authority
    public static final String AUTHORITY =
            "com.example.android.datasync.provider"
    // Account type
    public static final String ACCOUNT_TYPE = "com.example.android.datasync";
    // Account
    public static final String ACCOUNT = "default_account";
    // Instance fields
    Account mAccount;

    public void onRefreshButtonClick(View v) {
        ...
        // Pass the settings flags by inserting them in a bundle
        Bundle settingsBundle = new Bundle();
        settingsBundle.putBoolean(
                ContentResolver.SYNC_EXTRAS_MANUAL, true);
        settingsBundle.putBoolean(
                ContentResolver.SYNC_EXTRAS_EXPEDITED, true);
        /*

         * manual sync settings
         */
        ContentResolver.requestSync(mAccount, AUTHORITY, settingsBundle);
    }
</pre>
