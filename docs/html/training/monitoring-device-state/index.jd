<p>For your app to be a good citizen, it should seek to limit its impact on the battery life of its
device. After this class you will be able to build apps that modify their functionality
and behavior based on the state of its device.</p>

<p>By taking steps such as batching network requests, disabling background service updates when you
lose connectivity, or reducing the rate of such updates when the battery level is low, you can
ensure that the impact of your app on battery life is minimized, without compromising the user
experience.</p>

<h2>Lessons</h2>

<!-- Create a list of the lessons in this class along with a short description of each lesson.
These should be short and to the point. It should be clear from reading the summary whether someone
will want to jump to a lesson or not.-->

  <dd>Learn how to test and optimize your app for the power-management features introduced in
  Android 6.0 Marshmallow.</dd>

  <dt><b><a href="battery-monitoring.html">Monitoring the Battery Level and Charging State</a></b></dt>
  <dd>Learn how to alter your app's update rate by determining, and monitoring, the current battery
level and changes in charging state.</dd>

  <dt><b><a href="docking-monitoring.html">Determining and Monitoring the Docking State and
Type</a></b></dt>
  <dd>Optimal refresh rates can vary based on how the host device is being used. Learn how to
determine, and monitor, the docking state and type of dock being used to affect your app's
behavior.</dd>

  <dt><b><a href="connectivity-monitoring.html">Determining and Monitoring the Connectivity
Status</a></b></dt>
  <dd>Without Internet connectivity you can't update your app from an online source. Learn how to
check the connectivity status to alter your background update rate. You'll also learn to check for
Wi-Fi or mobile connectivity before beginning high-bandwidth operations.</dd>

  <dt><b><a href="manifest-receivers.html">Manipulating Broadcast Receivers On Demand</a></b></dt>
  <dd>Broadcast receivers that you've declared in the manifest can be toggled at runtime to disable
those that aren't necessary due to the current device state. Learn to improve
efficiency by toggling and cascading state change receivers and delay actions until the device is in
a specific state.</dd>
