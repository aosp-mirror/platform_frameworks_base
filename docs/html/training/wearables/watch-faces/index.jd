    <p>DevBytes: Watch Faces for Android Wear</p>
</div>
</a>

<p>Watch faces in Android Wear leverage a dynamic digital canvas to tell time using colors,
animations, and relevant contextual information. The <a
href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.wearable.app">Android
Wear companion app</a> provides watch faces with different styles and shapes. When
users select one of the available watch faces on the wearable or on the companion app, the
wearable device previews the watch face and lets the user set configuration options.</p>

<p>Android Wear enables you to create custom watch faces for Wear devices. When users install a
handheld app that contains a <a href="{@docRoot}training/wearables/apps/index.html">wearable
app</a> with watch faces, they become available in the Android Wear companion app
on the handheld device and in the watch face picker on the wearable device.</p>

<p>This class teaches you to implement custom watch faces and to package them inside a wearable
app. This class also covers design considerations and implementation tips to ensure that your
designs integrate with system UI elements and are power-efficient.</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> We recommend using <a
href="{@docRoot}sdk/index.html">Android Studio</a> for Android Wear development as
it provides project setup, library inclusion, and packaging conveniences that aren't available
in the Eclipse Android Developer Tools. This training assumes you are using Android Studio.</p>
