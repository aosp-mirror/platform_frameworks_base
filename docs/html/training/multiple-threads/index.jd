    The speed and efficiency of a long-running, data-intensive operation often improves when you
    split it into smaller operations running on multiple threads. On a device that has a CPU with
    multiple processors (cores), the system can run the threads in parallel, rather than making each
    sub-operation wait for a chance to run. For example, decoding multiple image files in order to
    display them on a thumbnail screen runs substantially faster when you do each decode on a
    separate thread.

    This class shows you how to set up and use multiple threads in an Android app, using a
    thread pool object. You'll also learn how to define code to run on a thread and how to
    communicate between one of these threads and the UI thread.

        Learn how to write code to run on a separate {@link java.lang.Thread}, by
        defining a class that implements the {@link java.lang.Runnable} interface.

        Learn how to create an object that manages a pool of {@link java.lang.Thread} objects and
        a queue of {@link java.lang.Runnable} objects. This object is called a
