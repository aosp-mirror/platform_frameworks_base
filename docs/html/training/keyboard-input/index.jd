<p>The Android system shows an on-screen keyboard&mdash;known as a
<em>soft input method</em>&mdash;when a text field in your UI receives focus.
To provide the best user experience, you can specify characteristics
about the type of input you expect (such as
whether it's a phone number or email address) and how the input method should behave (such as
whether it performs auto-correct for spelling mistakes).</p>

<p>In addition to the on-screen input methods, Android also supports hardware keyboards, so it's
important that your app optimize its user experience for interaction that might occur
through an attached keyboard.</p>

<p>These topics and more are discussed in the following lessons.</p>
