<p>
    Android allows you to transfer large files between devices using the Android Beam file transfer
    feature. This feature has a simple API and allows users to start the transfer process by simply
    touching devices. In response, Android Beam file transfer automatically copies files from one
    device to the other and notifies the user when it's finished.
</p>
<p>
    While the Android Beam file transfer API handles large amounts of data, the Android Beam NDEF
    transfer API introduced in Android 4.0 (API level 14) handles small amounts of data such as
    URIs or other small messages. In addition, Android Beam is only one of the features available
    in the Android NFC framework, which allows you to read NDEF messages from NFC tags. To learn
    more about Android Beam, see the topic

    >Beaming NDEF Messages to Other Devices</a>. To learn more about the NFC framework, see the
