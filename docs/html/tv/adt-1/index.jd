<p>The ADT-1 Developer Kit is a streaming media player and game controller designed for running
and testing apps built for Android TV. Supplies of ADT-1 are limited and it is intended for
developers who are interested in building new apps or extending their existing apps to run on the
Android TV platform.</p>

<p class="note">
  <strong>Note:</strong> The ADT-1 kit <em>is not required</em> for building and testing apps
  for Android TV. You can build apps for TV and test them using an emulator for TV devices. The
  Android SDK includes all the software needed to build TV apps and an emulator for running
  and testing them. For more information, see the
  <a href="{@docRoot}training/tv/start/index.html">Get Started</a> guide for TV apps.

<h2 id="faq">ADT-1 Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<p>The following information is provided to help set up and use the ADT-1 device.</p>


<h3 id="setup">Device Setup</h3>

<p>
  <strong>How do I turn my device on?</strong>
</p>
<p>Plug the included power cable into the back of ADT-1. The device does not have an on/off
  switch.</p>

<p>
  <strong>How do I completely turn my device off? </strong>
</p>
<p>Unplug the included power cable from the back of ADT-1. The device does not have an on/off
  switch. However, ADT-1 will begin sleeping (daydream) based on user settings in
  <strong>Settings &gt; Device &gt; Display &gt; Daydream</strong>.
  </p>

<p>
  <strong>How do I connect to the network?</strong>
</p>
<p>ADT-1 has both wireless and Ethernet for connecting to your network. To change your wireless
  network, go to <strong>Settings &gt; Device &gt; Wi-Fi</strong>. To use an Ethernet network
  connection, simply plug an Ethernet cable (that is connected to your network) into the port on
  the back of ADT-1.</p>

<p>
  <strong>How do I use the developer cable?</strong>
</p>
<p>The developer cable has three connectors: a small, male power connector that plugs into the
  power port on the back of ADT-1, a standard male USB-A connector that connects your PC, and a
  small, female power connector that the included power supply plugs into.</p>

<p class="note">
  <strong>Note:</strong> Make sure you have enabled USB debugging in <strong>Settings &gt;
  Preferences &gt; Developer options &gt; Debugging &gt; USB debugging</strong>, so that you can
  use the Android Debug Bridge (adb) to connect with the ADT-1 device.
</p>

<p id="adb-tcp">
  <strong>Can I connect without a developer cable?</strong>
</p>
<p>
  Yes. The ADT-1 device is enabled for Android Debug Bridge (adb) connections over TCP/IP. To
  connect to the ADT-1 device using this method:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Make sure that your development computer and the ADT-1 device are on the same network.</li>
  <li>Determine the IP address of the ADT-1 device by navigating to <strong>Settings &gt;
    Device &gt; Wi-Fi &gt; your-network-name &gt; Status info</strong>.</li>
  <li>Connect to the ADT-1 device using the following adb command:
<pre>
$ adb connect &lt;ip-address-for-adt-1&gt;:4321
</pre>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  <strong>How do I put the gamepad that came with my ADT-1 into pairing mode?</strong>
</p>
<p>Press and hold the Back and Home buttons together for about three seconds, until all four
  blue LEDs flash together. When the LEDs are flashing, the gamepad is in pairing mode.</p>

<p>
  <strong>How do I use the gamepad with the on-screen keyboard?</strong>
</p>
<p>Use the D-pad or left joystick to move the cursor, and press A to select. Press X to delete a

  lock, and press the left joystick to show additional symbols.</p>

<p>
  <strong>Can I control ADT-1 with my phone or tablet?</strong>
</p>
<p>Yes. In order to control the ADT-1 with Android phones or tablets, you can download a remote
  control app from the Google Play store. For more information, see <a href="#emote">Android TV
  Remote Control App</a>.
  </p>

<p>
  <strong>Can I connect a USB keyboard or mouse to ADT-1?</strong>
</p>
<p>Yes, you can connect a USB keyboard or mouse to the USB port on the back of ADT-1.

<p class="note">
  <strong>Note:</strong> The ADT-1 device is not compatible with all manufacturers and models of
  these devices. If a particular keyboard or mouse does not work, try a different model.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>How do I connect a Bluetooth device without an input device already attached?</strong>
</p>
<p>You can put ADT-1 into Bluetooth pairing mode using a hardware button. Press the small, round
  button on the back of ADT-1 to make it search for Bluetooth devices in pairing mode. If multiple
  accessories are found, press the small, round button to select the device you want to pair.
  Pairing will happen automatically after a few seconds.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>How do I connect additional Bluetooth accessories?</strong>

<p>To pair Bluetooth devices to ADT-1 from the user interface, go to <strong>Settings &gt;
  Remote &amp; Accessories &gt; Add accessory</strong>


<h3 id="cast">Google Cast</h3>

<p>
  <strong>Can I cast to an ADT-1 device?</strong>
<p>
<p>Yes. The ADT-1 includes Google Cast receiver functionality, similar to Chromecast. Since the
  ADT-1 is a developer device running a development software release, the Google Cast receiver is
  open only to a limited number of apps.</p>

<p>
  <strong>Which Cast apps are supported on ADT-1?</strong>
<p>
<p>As a developer device, the ADT-1 supports casting from only the following apps/websites:</p>

<ul>
  <li>YouTube</li>
  <li>Netflix</li>
  <li>Google+ Photos</li>
  <li>Google Play Movies and TV (Android and iOS only)</li>
  <li>Google Play Music</li>
  <li>Mirror your Android device screen to ADT-1</li>
</ul>

<p>Coming soon:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Google Play Movies and TV (Chrome)</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">
  <strong>Note:</strong> When casting from a Chrome browser, you must use Chrome V.36 or higher.
  Chrome V.36 is available in beta-channel and is planned to be released soon.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>How do I cast to ADT-1?</strong>
<p>
<p>You cast to an ADT-1 device the same way you do with a Chromecast device. Open the supported
  Cast apps or webpages, press the <strong>Cast</strong> button and you should see the ADT-1 as a
  Cast target. For more information about on how to cast, see
  <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/devices/chromecast/learn.html">Learn How to
  Cast</a>.
  </p>

<p>
  <strong>Will my Google Cast sender apps work on ADT-1 just like Chromecast?</strong>
<p>
<p>Yes. Your Cast app works on ADT-1 and Android TV products without additional work.<p>

<p class="note">
  <strong>Note:</strong> Your iOS sender app requires the Google Cast iOS API version 2.2.1
  or later to work with the ADT-1 device.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>How do I register my ADT-1 in order to run my apps?</strong>
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Go to <strong>Settings &gt; Device &gt; Google Cast</strong> and turn on developer support,
    allowing the ADT-1 device to send its serial number to Google.</li>
  <li>Register your ADT-1 device in the Google Cast Developer Console, using the 12 character
    serial number engraved on the back of the ADT-1.</li>
</ol>

<p>For more Google Cast developer information, see the
  <a href="https://developers.google.com/cast/">Cast developer site</a>. Please use the Google Cast
  SDK <a href="https://code.google.com/p/google-cast-sdk/issues/list">issue tracker</a> for filing
  issues related to Cast. Make sure you mention the ADT-1 device when filing an issue.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>How do I debug my Cast app on ADT-1?</strong>
</p>
<p>Connect your development platform using the power/USB cable, and using a Chrome browser,
  navigate to <code>chrome://inspect/#devices</code> to debug the webview.</p>
