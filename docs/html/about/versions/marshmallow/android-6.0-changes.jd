<p>Along with new features and capabilities, Android 6.0 (API level 23) includes a variety of
system changes and API behavior changes. This document highlights
some of the key changes that you should understand and account for in your apps.</p>

<p>If you have previously published an app for Android, be aware that these changes in the
platform affect your app.</p>

<h2 id="behavior-runtime-permissions">Runtime Permissions</h1>
<p>This release introduces a new permissions model, where users can now directly manage
app permissions at runtime. This model gives users improved visibility and control over
permissions, while streamlining the installation and auto-update processes for app developers.
Users can grant or revoke permissions individually for installed apps. </p>

<p>On your apps that target Android 6.0 (API level 23) or higher, make sure to check for and request
permissions at runtime. To determine if your app has been granted a permission, call the
new {@link android.content.Context#checkSelfPermission(java.lang.String) checkSelfPermission()}
method. To request a permission, call the new
{@link android.app.Activity#requestPermissions(java.lang.String[], int) requestPermissions()}
method. Even if your app is not targeting Android 6.0 (API level 23), you should test your app under
the new permissions model.</p>

<p>For details on supporting the new permissions model in your app, see
<a href="{@docRoot}training/permissions/index.html">
Working with System Permissions</a>. For tips on how to assess the impact on your app,
see <a href="{@docRoot}training/permissions/best-practices.html#testing">Permissions Best Practices</a>.</p>

<h2 id="behavior-power">Doze and App Standby</h2>
<p>This release introduces new power-saving optimizations for idle devices and apps. These
features affect all apps so make sure to test your apps in these new modes.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Doze</strong>: If a user unplugs a device and leaves it stationary, with its screen off,
for a period of time, the device goes into <em>Doze</em> mode, where it attempts to keep the system
in a sleep state. In this mode, devices periodically resume normal operations for brief periods of
time so that app syncing can occur and the system can perform any pending operations.
<li><strong>App Standby</strong>: App Standby allows the system to determine that an app is idle
when the user is not actively using it. The system makes this determination when the user does not
touch the app for a certain period of time. If the device is unplugged, the system disables network
access and suspends syncs and jobs for the apps it deems idle.</li>
</ul>

<p>To learn more about these power-saving changes, see
<a href="{@docRoot}training/monitoring-device-state/doze-standby.html">Optimizing for Doze and App Standby</a>.</p>

<h2 id="behavior-apache-http-client">Apache HTTP Client Removal</h2>

<p>Android 6.0 release removes support for the Apache HTTP client. If your app is using this client and
targets Android 2.3 (API level 9) or higher, use the {@link java.net.HttpURLConnection} class
instead. This API is more efficient because it reduces network use through transparent compression
and response caching, and minimizes power consumption. To continue using the Apache HTTP APIs, you
must first declare the following compile-time dependency in your {@code build.gradle} file:
</p>
<pre>
android {
    useLibrary 'org.apache.http.legacy'
}
</pre>

<h2 id="boringSSL">BoringSSL </h2>

<p>Android is moving away from OpenSSL to the
<a href="https://boringssl.googlesource.com/boringssl/" class="external-link">BoringSSL</a>
library. If you’re using the Android NDK in your app, don't link against cryptographic libraries
that are not a part of the NDK API, such as {@code libcrypto.so} and {@code libssl.so}. These
libraries are not public APIs, and may change or break without notice across releases and devices.
In addition, you may expose yourself to security vulnerabilities. Instead, modify your
native code to call the Java cryptography APIs via JNI or to statically link against a
cryptography library of your choice.</p>

<h2 id="behavior-hardware-id">Access to Hardware Identifier</h2>
<p>To provide users with greater data protection, starting in this release, Android
removes programmatic access to the device’s local hardware identifier for
apps using the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth APIs. The
{@link android.net.wifi.WifiInfo#getMacAddress() WifiInfo.getMacAddress()} and the
{@link android.bluetooth.BluetoothAdapter#getAddress() BluetoothAdapter.getAddress()} methods
now return a constant value of {@code 02:00:00:00:00:00}.</p>

<p>To access the hardware identifiers of nearby external devices via Bluetooth and Wi-Fi scans,
your app must now have the {@link android.Manifest.permission#ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION} or
{@link android.Manifest.permission#ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION} permissions:</p>
<ul>
<li>{@link android.net.wifi.WifiManager#getScanResults() WifiManager.getScanResults()}</li>
<li>{@link android.bluetooth.BluetoothDevice#ACTION_FOUND BluetoothDevice.ACTION_FOUND}</li>
<li>{@link android.bluetooth.le.BluetoothLeScanner#startScan(android.bluetooth.le.ScanCallback)
BluetoothLeScanner.startScan()}</li>
</ul>

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: When a device running Android 6.0 (API level 23) initiates a
background Wi-Fi or Bluetooth scan, the operation is visible to external devices as
originating from a randomized MAC address.</p>

<h2 id="behavior-notifications">Notifications</h2>
<p>
This release removes the {@code Notification.setLatestEventInfo()} method. Use the
{@link android.app.Notification.Builder} class instead to construct notifications. To update a
notification repeatedly, reuse the {@link android.app.Notification.Builder} instance. Call the
{@link android.app.Notification.Builder#build()} method to get
updated {@link android.app.Notification} instances.
</p>
<p>The {@code adb shell dumpsys notification} command no longer prints out your notification text.
Use the {@code adb shell dumpsys notification --noredact} command instead to print out the text
in a notification object.</p>

<h2 id="behavior-audiomanager-Changes">AudioManager Changes</h2>
<p>Setting the volume directly or muting specific streams via the {@link android.media.AudioManager}
class is no longer supported. The {@link android.media.AudioManager#setStreamSolo(int,boolean)
setStreamSolo()} method is deprecated, and you should call the
{@link android.media.AudioManager#requestAudioFocus(android.media.AudioManager.OnAudioFocusChangeListener, int, int) requestAudioFocus()}
method instead. Similarly, the
{@link android.media.AudioManager#setStreamMute(int,boolean) setStreamMute()} method is
deprecated; instead, call the {@link android.media.AudioManager#adjustStreamVolume(int, int, int)
adjustStreamVolume()} method and pass in the direction value
{@link android.media.AudioManager#ADJUST_MUTE} or
{@link android.media.AudioManager#ADJUST_UNMUTE}.</p>


<h2 id="behavior-text-selection">Text Selection</h2>

<img src="{@docRoot}images/android-6.0/text-selection.gif"
style="float:right; margin:0 0 20px 30px" width="360" height="640" />

<p>When users select text in your app, you can now display text selection actions such as
<em>Cut</em>, <em>Copy</em>, and <em>Paste</em> in a
<a href="http://www.google.com/design/spec/patterns/selection.html#selection-text-selection"
class="external-link">floating toolbar</a>. The user interaction implementation is similar to that
for the contextual action bar, as described in
<a href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/ui/menus.html#CABforViews">
Enabling the contextual action mode for individual views</a>.</p>

<p>To implement a floating toolbar for text selection, make the following changes in your existing
apps:</p>
<ol>
<li>In your {@link android.view.View} or {@link android.app.Activity} object, change your
{@link android.view.ActionMode} calls from
{@code startActionMode(Callback)} to {@code startActionMode(Callback, ActionMode.TYPE_FLOATING)}.</li>
<li>Take your existing implementation of {@code ActionMode.Callback} and make it extend
{@link android.view.ActionMode.Callback2} instead.</li>
<li>Override the
{@link android.view.ActionMode.Callback2#onGetContentRect(android.view.ActionMode, android.view.View, android.graphics.Rect) onGetContentRect()}
method to provide the coordinates of the content {@link android.graphics.Rect} object
(such as a text selection rectangle) in the view.</li>
<li>If the rectangle positioning is no longer valid, and this is the only element to be invalidated,
call the {@link android.view.ActionMode#invalidateContentRect() invalidateContentRect()} method.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you are using <a href="{@docRoot}tools/support-library/index.html">
Android Support Library</a> revision 22.2, be aware that floating toolbars are not
backward-compatible and appcompat takes control over {@link android.view.ActionMode} objects by
default. This prevents floating toolbars from being displayed. To enable
{@link android.view.ActionMode} support in an
{@link android.support.v7.app.AppCompatActivity}, call
{@link android.support.v7.app.AppCompatActivity#getDelegate()}, then call
{@link android.support.v7.app.AppCompatDelegate#setHandleNativeActionModesEnabled(boolean)
setHandleNativeActionModesEnabled()} on the returned
{@link android.support.v7.app.AppCompatDelegate} object and set the input
parameter to {@code false}. This call returns control of {@link android.view.ActionMode} objects to
the framework. In devices running Android 6.0 (API level 23), that allows the framework to support
{@link android.support.v7.app.ActionBar} or floating toolbar modes, while on devices running
Android 5.1 (API level 22) or lower, only the {@link android.support.v7.app.ActionBar} modes are
supported.</p>

<h2 id="behavior-bookmark-browser">Browser Bookmark Changes</h2>
<p>This release removes support for global bookmarks. The
{@code android.provider.Browser.getAllBookmarks()} and {@code android.provider.Browser.saveBookmark()}
methods are now removed. Likewise, the {@code READ_HISTORY_BOOKMARKS} and {@code WRITE_HISTORY_BOOKMARKS}
permissions are removed. If your app targets Android 6.0 (API level 23) or higher, don't access
bookmarks from the global provider or use the bookmark permissions. Instead, your app should store
bookmarks data internally.</p>

<h2 id="behavior-keystore">Android Keystore Changes</h2>
<p>With this release, the
<a href="{@docRoot}training/articles/keystore.html">Android Keystore provider</a> no longer supports
DSA. ECDSA is still supported.</p>

<p>Keys which do not require encryption at rest will no longer be deleted when secure lock screen
is disabled or reset (for example, by the user or a Device Administrator). Keys which require
encryption at rest will be deleted during these events.</p>

<h2 id="behavior-network">Wi-Fi and Networking Changes</h2>

<p>This release introduces the following behavior changes to the Wi-Fi and networking APIs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Your apps can now change the state of {@link android.net.wifi.WifiConfiguration} objects only
if you created these objects. You are not permitted to modify or delete
{@link android.net.wifi.WifiConfiguration} objects created by the user or by other apps.
</li>
<li>
Previously, if an app forced the device to connect to a specific Wi-Fi network by using
{@link android.net.wifi.WifiManager#enableNetwork(int,boolean) enableNetwork()} with the
{@code disableAllOthers=true} setting, the device disconnected from other networks such as
cellular data. In This release, the device no longer disconnects from such other networks. If
your app’s {@code targetSdkVersion} is {@code “20”} or lower, it is pinned to the selected
Wi-Fi network. If your app’s {@code targetSdkVersion} is {@code “21”} or higher, use the
multinetwork APIs (such as
{@link android.net.Network#openConnection(java.net.URL) openConnection()},
{@link android.net.Network#bindSocket(java.net.Socket) bindSocket()}, and the new
{@link android.net.ConnectivityManager#bindProcessToNetwork(android.net.Network)
bindProcessToNetwork()} method) to ensure that its network traffic is sent on the selected network.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="behavior-camera">Camera Service Changes</h2>
<p>In This release, the model for accessing shared resources in the camera service has been changed
from the previous “first come, first serve” access model to an access model where high-priority
processes are favored.  Changes to the service behavior include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Access to camera subsystem resources, including opening and configuring a camera device, is
awarded based on the “priority” of the client application process. Application processes with
user-visible or foreground activities are generally given a higher-priority, making camera resource
acquisition and use more dependable.</li>
<li>Active camera clients for lower priority apps may be “evicted” when a higher priority
application attempts to use the camera.  In the deprecated {@link android.hardware.Camera} API,
this results in
{@link android.hardware.Camera.ErrorCallback#onError(int,android.hardware.Camera) onError()} being
called for the evicted client. In the {@link android.hardware.camera2 Camera2} API, it results in
{@link android.hardware.camera2.CameraDevice.StateCallback#onDisconnected(android.hardware.camera2.CameraDevice) onDisconnected()}
being called for the evicted client.</li>
<li>On devices with appropriate camera hardware, separate application processes are able to
independently open and use separate camera devices simultaneously. However, multi-process use
cases, where simultaneous access causes significant degradation of performance or capabilities of
any of the open camera devices, are now detected and disallowed by the camera service. This change
may result in “evictions” for lower priority clients even when no other app is directly
attempting to access the same camera device.
</li>
<li>
Changing the current user causes active camera clients in apps owned by the previous user account
to be evicted.  Access to the camera is limited to user profiles owned by the current device user.
In practice, this means that a “Guest” account, for example, will not be able to leave running
processes that use the camera subsystem when the user has switched to a different account.
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="behavior-runtime">Runtime</h2>
<p>The ART runtime now properly implements access rules for the
{@link java.lang.reflect.Constructor#newInstance(java.lang.Object...) newInstance()} method. This
change fixes a problem where Dalvik was checking access rules incorrectly in previous versions.
If your app uses the
{@link java.lang.reflect.Constructor#newInstance(java.lang.Object...) newInstance()} method and you
want to override access checks, call the
{@link java.lang.reflect.AccessibleObject#setAccessible(boolean) setAccessible()} method with the input
parameter set to {@code true}. If your app uses the
<a href="{@docRoot}tools/support-library/features.html#v7-appcompat">v7 appcompat library</a> or the
<a href="{@docRoot}tools/support-library/features.html#v7-recyclerview">v7 recyclerview library</a>,
you must update your app to use to the latest versions of these libraries. Otherwise, make sure that
any custom classes referenced from XML are updated so that their class constructors are accessible.</p>

<p>This release updates the behavior of the dynamic linker. The dynamic linker now understands the
difference between a library’s {@code soname} and its path
(<a href="https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=6670" class="external-link">
public bug 6670</a>), and search by {@code soname} is now
implemented. Apps which previously worked that have bad {@code DT_NEEDED} entries
(usually absolute paths on the build machine’s file system) may fail when loaded.</p>

<p>The {@code dlopen(3) RTLD_LOCAL} flag is now correctly implemented. Note that
{@code RTLD_LOCAL} is the default, so calls to {@code dlopen(3)} that didn’t explicitly use
{@code RTLD_LOCAL} will be affected (unless your app explicitly used {@code RTLD_GLOBAL}). With
{@code RTLD_LOCAL}, symbols will not be made available to libraries loaded by later calls to
{@code dlopen(3)} (as opposed to being referenced by {@code DT_NEEDED} entries).</p>
</p>

<p>
On previous versions of Android, if your app requested the system to load a shared library with
text relocations, the system displayed a warning but still allowed the library to be loaded.
Beginning in this release, the system rejects this library if your app's target SDK version is 23
or higher. To help you detect if a library failed to load, your app should log the
{@code dlopen(3)} failure, and include the problem description text that the {@code dlerror(3)}
call returns. To learn more about handling text relocations, see this
<a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Hardened/Textrels_Guide" class="external-link">guide</a>.</p>

<h2 id="behavior-apk-validation">APK Validation</h2>
<p>The platform now performs stricter validation of APKs. An APK is considered corrupt if a file is
declared in the manifest but not present in the APK itself. An APK must be re-signed if any of the
contents are removed.</p>

<h2 id="behavior-usb">USB Connection</h2>
<p>Device connections through the USB port are now set to charge-only mode by default. To access
the device and its content over a USB connection, users must explicitly grant permission for such
interactions. If your app supports user interactions with the device over a USB port, take into
consideration that the interaction must be explicitly enabled.
</p>

<h2 id="behavior-afw">Android for Work Changes</h2>
<p>This release includes the following behavior changes for Android for Work:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Work contacts in personal contexts.</strong> The Google Dialer
Call Log now displays work contacts when the user views past calls.
Setting
{@link android.app.admin.DevicePolicyManager#setCrossProfileCallerIdDisabled(android.content.ComponentName, boolean) setCrossProfileCallerIdDisabled()}
to {@code true} hides the work profile contacts in the Google Dialer Call Log. Work contacts can be
displayed along with personal contacts to devices over Bluetooth only if
you set {@link android.app.admin.DevicePolicyManager#setBluetoothContactSharingDisabled(android.content.ComponentName, boolean)
setBluetoothContactSharingDisabled()} to {@code false}. By default, it is set to {@code true}.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Wi-Fi configuration removal:</strong> Wi-Fi configurations added by a Profile Owner
(for example, through calls to the
{@link android.net.wifi.WifiManager#addNetwork(android.net.wifi.WifiConfiguration)
addNetwork()} method) are now removed if that work profile is deleted.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Wi-Fi configuration lockdown:</strong> Any Wi-Fi configuration created by
  an active Device Owner can no longer be modified or deleted by the user if
  {@link android.provider.Settings.Global#WIFI_DEVICE_OWNER_CONFIGS_LOCKDOWN} is non-zero.
  The user can still create and modify their own Wi-Fi configurations. Active Device
  Owners have the privilege of editing or removing any Wi-Fi configurations, including
  those not created by them.
  </li>
<li><strong>Download device policy controller via Google account addition:</strong> When a Google
account that requires management via a device policy controller (DPC) app is added to a device
outside of a managed context, the add account flow now prompts the user to install the
appropriate WPC. This behavior also applies to accounts added via
<strong>Settings > Accounts</strong> and in the initial device setup wizard.</li>
<li><strong>Changes to specific {@link android.app.admin.DevicePolicyManager} API behaviors:</strong>
  <ul>
  <li>Calling the
{@link android.app.admin.DevicePolicyManager#setCameraDisabled(android.content.ComponentName,boolean) setCameraDisabled()}
method affects the camera for the calling user only; calling it from the managed profile doesn’t
affect camera apps running on the primary user.</li>
  <li>In addition, the
{@link android.app.admin.DevicePolicyManager#setKeyguardDisabledFeatures(android.content.ComponentName,int) setKeyguardDisabledFeatures()}
    method is now available for Profile Owners, as well as to Device Owners. </li>
  <li>A Profile Owner can set these keyguard restrictions:
    <ul>
    <li>{@link android.app.admin.DevicePolicyManager#KEYGUARD_DISABLE_TRUST_AGENTS} and
    {@link android.app.admin.DevicePolicyManager#KEYGUARD_DISABLE_FINGERPRINT}, which affect the
    keyguard settings for the profile’s parent user.</li>
    <li>{@link android.app.admin.DevicePolicyManager#KEYGUARD_DISABLE_UNREDACTED_NOTIFICATIONS}, which
    only affects notifications generated by applications in the managed profile.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The {@code DevicePolicyManager.createAndInitializeUser()} and {@code DevicePolicyManager.createUser()} methods have been deprecated.</li>
  <li>The {@link android.app.admin.DevicePolicyManager#setScreenCaptureDisabled(android.content.ComponentName, boolean) setScreenCaptureDisabled()}
method now also blocks the assist structure when an app of the given user is in the foreground. </li>
  <li>{@link android.app.admin.DevicePolicyManager#EXTRA_PROVISIONING_DEVICE_ADMIN_PACKAGE_CHECKSUM}
now defaults to SHA-256. SHA-1 is still supported for backwards compatibility but will be removed
in future.
{@link android.app.admin.DevicePolicyManager#EXTRA_PROVISIONING_DEVICE_ADMIN_SIGNATURE_CHECKSUM}
now only accepts SHA-256.</li>
  <li>Device initializer APIs which existed in the Android 6.0 (API level 23) are now removed.</li>
    <li><code>EXTRA_PROVISIONING_RESET_PROTECTION_PARAMETERS</code> is removed so NFC bump
provisioning cannot programmatically unlock a factory reset protected device.</li>
<li>You can now use the {@link android.app.admin.DevicePolicyManager#EXTRA_PROVISIONING_ADMIN_EXTRAS_BUNDLE}
extra to pass data to the device owner app during NFC provisioning of the managed device.</li>
    <li>Android for Work APIs are optimized for M runtime permissions, including Work profiles,
assist layer, and others. New {@link android.app.admin.DevicePolicyManager} permission APIs don't
affect pre-M apps.</li>
<li>When users back out of the synchronous part of the setup flow initiated through an
{@link android.app.admin.DevicePolicyManager#ACTION_PROVISION_MANAGED_PROFILE} or
{@link android.app.admin.DevicePolicyManager#ACTION_PROVISION_MANAGED_DEVICE} intent, the system
now returns a {@link android.app.Activity#RESULT_CANCELED} result code.</li>
    </ul></li>

<li><strong>Changes to other APIs</strong>:
<ul>
    <li>Data Usage: The {@code android.app.usage.NetworkUsageStats} class has been renamed
{@link android.app.usage.NetworkStats}.</li>
</ul>
    </li>

    <li><strong>Changes to global settings</strong>:
    <ul>
    <li>These settings can no longer be set via {@link android.app.admin.DevicePolicyManager#setGlobalSetting(android.content.ComponentName, java.lang.String, java.lang.String) setGlobalSettings()}</code>:
<ul>
    <li><code>BLUETOOTH_ON</code></li>
    <li><code>DEVELOPMENT_SETTINGS_ENABLED</code></li>
    <li><code>MODE_RINGER</code></li>
    <li><code>NETWORK_PREFERENCE</code></li>
    <li><code>WIFI_ON</code></li>
</ul>
    </li>
    <li>These global settings can now be set via {@link android.app.admin.DevicePolicyManager#setGlobalSetting(android.content.ComponentName, java.lang.String, java.lang.String) setGlobalSettings()}:
    <ul>
    <li>{@link android.provider.Settings.Global#WIFI_DEVICE_OWNER_CONFIGS_LOCKDOWN}</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    </ul>
</ul>
