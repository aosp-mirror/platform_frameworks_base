<p>The Android SDK is composed of modular packages that you can download separately using
the Android SDK Manager. For example, when the SDK Tools are updated or a new version of
the Android platform is released, you can use the SDK Manager to quickly download them to
your environment. Simply follow the procedures described in <a
href="{@docRoot}sdk/installing/adding-packages.html">Adding Platforms and Packages</a>.</p>

<p>There are several different packages available for the Android SDK. The table below describes
most of the available packages and where they're located once you download them.</p>


<h2 id="Packages">Available Packages</h2>


<table>
  <tr><th>Package</th><th>Description</th><th>File Location</th></tr>
  <tr>
    <td><a href="{@docRoot}tools/sdk/tools-notes.html">SDK Tools</a></td>
    <td>Contains tools for debugging and testing, plus other
utilities that are required to develop an app. If you've just installed the SDK starter package,
then you already have the latest version of this package. Make sure you keep this up to date.</td>
    <td>{@code &lt;sdk>/tools/}</td></tr>
  <tr><td>SDK Platform-tools</td>
    <td>Contains platform-dependent tools for developing and debugging
your application. These tools support the latest features of the Android platform and are typically
updated only when a new platform becomes available. These tools are always backward compatible with
older platforms, but you must be sure that you have the latest version of these tools when you
install a new SDK platform.</td>
    <td>{@code &lt;sdk>/platform-tools/}</td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>Documentation</td>
    <td>An offline copy of the latest documentation for the Android
platform APIs.</td>
    <td>{@code &lt;sdk>/docs/}</td>
  </tr>
  <tr><td>SDK Platform</td>
    <td>There's one SDK Platform available for each version of Android. It includes an {@code
android.jar} file with a fully compliant Android library. In order to build an Android app, you must
specify an SDK platform as your build target.</td>
    <td>{@code &lt;sdk>/platforms/&lt;android-version>/}</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>System Images</td>
    <td>Each platform version offers one or more different system images (such as for ARM
and x86). The Android emulator requires a system image to operate. You should always test your
app on the latest version of Android and using the emulator with the latest system image is a
good way to do so.</td>
    <td>{@code &lt;sdk>/platforms/&lt;android-version>/}</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Sources for Android SDK</td>
    <td>A copy of the Android platform source code that's useful for
stepping through the code while debugging your app.</td>
    <td>{@code &lt;sdk>/sources/}</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><a href="{@docRoot}tools/samples/index.html">Samples for SDK</a></td>
    <td>A collection of sample apps that demonstrate a variety of the
platform APIs. These are a great resource to browse Android app code. The API Demos app in
particular provides a huge number of small demos you should explore.</td>
    <td>{@code &lt;sdk>/platforms/&lt;android-version>/samples/}</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><a href="http://developers.google.com/android">Google APIs</a></td>
    <td>An SDK add-on that provides both a platform you can use to develop an app
using special Google APIs and a system image for the emulator so you can test your app using the
Google APIs.</td>
    <td>{@code &lt;sdk>/add-ons/}</td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td><a href="{@docRoot}tools/extras/support-library.html">Android Support</a></td>
    <td>A static library you can include in your app sources in order to use powerful
APIs that aren't available in the standard platform. For example, the support library
contains versions of the {@link android.support.v4.app.Fragment} class that's compatible with
Android 1.6 and higher (the class was originally introduced in Android 3.0) and the {@link
android.support.v4.view.ViewPager} APIs that allow you to easily build a side-swipeable UI.</td>
    <td>{@code &lt;sdk>/extras/android/support/}</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><a href="{@docRoot}guide/google/play/billing/index.html">Google Play Billing</a></td>
    <td>Provides the static libraries and samples that allow you to
integrate billing services in your app with Google Play.</td>
    <td>{@code &lt;sdk>/extras/google/}</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><a href="{@docRoot}guide/google/play/licensing/index.html">Google Play Licensing</a></td>
    <td>Provides the static libraries and samples that allow you to perform license verification for
your app when distributing with Google Play.</td>
    <td>{@code &lt;sdk>/extras/google/}</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>The above table is not comprehensive and you can <a
href="#AddingSites">add new sites</a> to download additional packages from third-parties.</p>

<p>In some cases, an SDK package may require a specific minimum revision of
another package or SDK tool. For example, there may be a dependency between the ADT Plugin for
Eclipse and
the SDK Tools package. When you install the SDK Tools
package, you should also upgrade to the required version of ADT (if you
are developing in Eclipse). In this case,  the major version number for your ADT plugin should
always match the revision number of your SDK Tools (for example, ADT 8.x requires SDK Tools r8).
</p>

<p>The development tools will notify you with debug warnings if there is dependency that you need to
address. The Android SDK Manager also enforces dependencies by requiring that you download any
packages that are needed by those you have selected.</p>





<h2 id="AddingSites">Adding New Sites</h2>

<p>By default, <strong>Available Packages</strong> displays packages available from the
<em>Android Repository</em> and <em>Third party Add-ons</em>. You can add other sites that host
their own Android SDK add-ons, then download the SDK add-ons
from those sites.</p>

<p>For example, a mobile carrier or device manufacturer might offer additional
API libraries that are supported by their own Android-powered devices. In order
to develop using their libraries, you must install their Android SDK add-on, if it's not already
available under <em>Third party Add-ons</em>. </p>

<p>If a carrier or device manufacturer has hosted an SDK add-on repository file
on their web site, follow these steps to add their site to the Android SDK
Manager:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Select <strong>Available Packages</strong> in the left panel.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Add Add-on Site</strong> and enter the URL of the
<code>repository.xml</code> file. Click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Any SDK packages available from the site will now be listed under a new item named
<strong>User Add-ons</strong>.</p>




<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>

<p><strong>Problems connecting to the SDK repository</strong></p>

<p>If you are using the Android SDK Manager to download packages and are encountering
connection problems, try connecting over http, rather than https. To switch the
protocol used by the Android SDK Manager, follow these steps: </p>

<ol>
  <li>With the Android SDK Manager window open, select "Settings" in the
  left pane. </li>
  <li>On the right, in the "Misc" section, check the checkbox labeled "Force
  https://... sources to be fetched using http://..." </li>
  <li>Click <strong>Save &amp; Apply</strong>.</li>
</ol>
