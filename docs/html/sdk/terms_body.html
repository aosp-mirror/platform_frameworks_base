<p>This is the Android Software Development Kit License Agreement.</p>

<h2>
  1. Introduction
</h2>

<p>
  1.1 The Android Software Development Kit (referred to in the License Agreement as the "SDK" and
  specifically including the Android system files, packaged APIs, and Google APIs add-ons) is
  licensed to you subject to the terms of the License Agreement. The License Agreement forms a
  legally binding contract between you and Google in relation to your use of the SDK.
</p>

<p>
  1.2 "Android" means the Android software stack for devices, as made available under the Android
  Open Source Project, which is located at the following URL: http://source.android.com/, as
  updated from time to time.
</p>

<p>
  1.3 A "compatible implementation" means any Android device that (i) complies with the Android
  Compatibility Definition document, which can be found at the Android compatibility website
  (http://source.android.com/compatibility) and which may be updated from time to time; and (ii)
  successfully passes the Android Compatibility Test Suite (CTS).
</p>

<p>

  Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States.
</p>

<h2>
  2. Accepting this License Agreement
</h2>

<p>
  2.1 In order to use the SDK, you must first agree to the License Agreement. You may not use the
  SDK if you do not accept the License Agreement.
</p>

<p>
  2.2 By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the License Agreement.
</p>

<p>
  2.3 You may not use the SDK and may not accept the License Agreement if you are a person barred
  from receiving the SDK under the laws of the United States or other countries, including the
  country in which you are resident or from which you use the SDK.
</p>

<p>
  2.4 If you are agreeing to be bound by the License Agreement on behalf of your employer or other
  entity, you represent and warrant that you have full legal authority to bind your employer or
  such entity to the License Agreement. If you do not have the requisite authority, you may not

</p>

<h2>
  3. SDK License from Google
</h2>

<p>
  3.1 Subject to the terms of the License Agreement, Google grants you a limited, worldwide,
  royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive, and non-sublicensable license to use the SDK solely
  to develop applications for compatible implementations of Android.
</p>

<p>
  3.2 You may not use this SDK to develop applications for other platforms (including
  non-compatible implementations of Android) or to develop another SDK. You are of course free to
  develop applications for other platforms, including non-compatible implementations of Android,
  provided that this SDK is not used for that purpose.
</p>

<p>
  3.3 You agree that Google or third parties own all legal right, title and interest in and to the
  SDK, including any Intellectual Property Rights that subsist in the SDK. "Intellectual Property
  Rights" means any and all rights under patent law, copyright law, trade secret law, trademark
  law, and any and all other proprietary rights. Google reserves all rights not expressly granted
  to you.
</p>

<p>
  3.4 You may not use the SDK for any purpose not expressly permitted by the License Agreement.
  Except to the extent required by applicable third party licenses, you may not: (a) copy (except
  for backup purposes), modify, adapt, redistribute, decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, or
  create derivative works of the SDK or any part of the SDK; or (b) load any part of the SDK onto a
  mobile handset or any other hardware device except a personal computer, combine any part of the
  SDK with other software, or distribute any software or device incorporating a part of the SDK.
</p>

<p>
  3.5 Use, reproduction and distribution of components of the SDK licensed under an open source
  software license are governed solely by the terms of that open source software license and not
  the License Agreement.
</p>

<p>
  3.6 You agree that the form and nature of the SDK that Google provides may change without prior
  notice to you and that future versions of the SDK may be incompatible with applications developed
  on previous versions of the SDK. You agree that Google may stop (permanently or temporarily)
  providing the SDK (or any features within the SDK) to you or to users generally at Google's sole
  discretion, without prior notice to you.
</p>

<p>
  3.7 Nothing in the License Agreement gives you a right to use any of Google's trade names,
  trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, or other distinctive brand features.
</p>

<p>
  3.8 You agree that you will not remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary rights notices
  (including copyright and trademark notices) that may be affixed to or contained within the SDK.
</p>

<h2>
  4. Use of the SDK by You
</h2>

<p>
  4.1 Google agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors) under
  the License Agreement in or to any software applications that you develop using the SDK,
  including any intellectual property rights that subsist in those applications.
</p>

<p>
  4.2 You agree to use the SDK and write applications only for purposes that are permitted by (a)
  the License Agreement and (b) any applicable law, regulation or generally accepted practices or
  guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions (including any laws regarding the export of data or
  software to and from the United States or other relevant countries).
</p>

<p>
  4.3 You agree that if you use the SDK to develop applications for general public users, you will
  protect the privacy and legal rights of those users. If the users provide you with user names,
  passwords, or other login information or personal information, you must make the users aware that
  the information will be available to your application, and you must provide legally adequate
  privacy notice and protection for those users. If your application stores personal or sensitive
  information provided by users, it must do so securely. If the user provides your application with
  Google Account information, your application may only use that information to access the user's
  Google Account when, and for the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission to
  do so.
</p>

<p>
  4.4 You agree that you will not engage in any activity with the SDK, including the development or
  distribution of an application, that interferes with, disrupts, damages, or accesses in an
  unauthorized manner the servers, networks, or other properties or services of any third party
  including, but not limited to, Google or any mobile communications carrier.
</p>

<p>
  4.5 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to you
  or to any third party for) any data, content, or resources that you create, transmit or display
  through Android and/or applications for Android, and for the consequences of your actions
  (including any loss or damage which Google may suffer) by doing so.
</p>

<p>
  4.6 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to you
  or to any third party for) any breach of your obligations under the License Agreement, any
  applicable third party contract or Terms of Service, or any applicable law or regulation, and for
  the consequences (including any loss or damage which Google or any third party may suffer) of any
  such breach.
</p>

<h2>
  5. Your Developer Credentials
</h2>

<p>
  5.1 You agree that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any developer
  credentials that may be issued to you by Google or which you may choose yourself and that you
  will be solely responsible for all applications that are developed under your developer
  credentials.
</p>

<h2>
  6. Privacy and Information
</h2>

<p>
  6.1 In order to continually innovate and improve the SDK, Google may collect certain usage
  statistics from the software including but not limited to a unique identifier, associated IP
  address, version number of the software, and information on which tools and/or services in the
  SDK are being used and how they are being used. Before any of this information is collected, the
  SDK will notify you and seek your consent. If you withhold consent, the information will not be
  collected.
</p>

<p>
  6.2 The data collected is examined in the aggregate to improve the SDK and is maintained in
  accordance with Google's Privacy Policy.
</p>

<h2>
  7. Third Party Applications
</h2>

<p>
  7.1 If you use the SDK to run applications developed by a third party or that access data,
  content or resources provided by a third party, you agree that Google is not responsible for
  those applications, data, content, or resources. You understand that all data, content or
  resources which you may access through such third party applications are the sole responsibility
  of the person from which they originated and that Google is not liable for any loss or damage
  that you may experience as a result of the use or access of any of those third party
  applications, data, content, or resources.
</p>

<p>
  7.2 You should be aware the data, content, and resources presented to you through such a third
  party application may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by the
  providers (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). You may not modify, rent, lease,
  loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on these data, content, or resources
  (either in whole or in part) unless you have been specifically given permission to do so by the
  relevant owners.
</p>

<p>
  7.3 You acknowledge that your use of such third party applications, data, content, or resources
  may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third party. In that case, the
  License Agreement does not affect your legal relationship with these third parties.
</p>

<h2>
  8. Using Android APIs
</h2>

<p>
  8.1 Google Data APIs
</p>

<p>
  8.1.1 If you use any API to retrieve data from Google, you acknowledge that the data may be
  protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by Google or those parties that provide
  the data (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). Your use of any such API may be
  subject to additional Terms of Service. You may not modify, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute
  or create derivative works based on this data (either in whole or in part) unless allowed by the
  relevant Terms of Service.
</p>

<p>
  8.1.2 If you use any API to retrieve a user's data from Google, you acknowledge and agree that
  you shall retrieve data only with the user's explicit consent and only when, and for the limited
  purposes for which, the user has given you permission to do so.
</p>

<h2>

</p>

<p>
  14.2 You agree that if Google does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which is
  contained in the License Agreement (or which Google has the benefit of under any applicable law),
  this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Google's rights and that those rights or remedies
  will still be available to Google.
</p>

<p>
  14.3 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any
  provision of the License Agreement is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the

  of the License Agreement will continue to be valid and enforceable.
</p>

<p>
  14.4 You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which Google is the
  parent shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement and that such other companies

  provisions. You and Google agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located
  within the county of Santa Clara, California to resolve any legal matter arising from the License
  Agreement. Notwithstanding this, you agree that Google shall still be allowed to apply for
  injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction.
