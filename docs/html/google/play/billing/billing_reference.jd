<p>This documentation provides technical reference information for using the In-app Billing Version 3 API. </p>

<h2 id="billing-codes">Server Response Codes</h2>
<p>The following table lists all of the server response codes that are sent from Google Play to your application. Google Play sends the response code synchronously as an integer mapped to the {@code RESPONSE_CODE} key in the response {@code Bundle}. Your application must handle all of these response codes.</p>

<h2 id="billing-interface">API Reference</h2>
<p>The In-app Billing Version 3 API is defined in the {@code IInAppBillingService.aidl} file, which is included with the Version 3 <a href="{@docRoot}training/in-app-billing/preparing-iab-app.html#GetSample">sample application</a>.</p>

<h3 id="getSkuDetails">The getSkuDetails() method</h3>
<p>This method returns product details for a list of product IDs. In the response {@code Bundle} sent by Google Play, the query results are stored in a String {@code ArrayList} mapped to the {@code DETAILS_LIST} key. Each String in the details list contains product details for a single product in JSON format. The fields in the JSON string with the product details are summarized in table 2.</p>

<h3 id="getBuyIntent">The getBuyIntent() method</h3>
<p>
  This method returns a response code integer mapped to the {@code
  RESPONSE_CODE} key, and a {@link android.app.PendingIntent} to launch the
  purchase flow for the in-app item mapped to the {@code BUY_INTENT} key, as
  described in <a href=
  "{@docRoot}google/play/billing/billing_integrate.html#purchase">Purchasing an
  Item</a>. When it receives the {@link android.app.PendingIntent}, Google Play
  sends a response {@code Intent} with the data for that purchase order. The
  data that is returned in the response {@code Intent} is summarized in table
  3.

<h3 id="upgrade-getBuyIntentToReplaceSkus">The getBuyIntentToReplaceSkus()
  method</h3>

<p>This method is used to upgrade or downgrade a subscription purchase. The method
is similar to <a href="#getBuyIntent"><code>getBuyIntent()</code></a>, except
that it takes a list of already-purchased SKUs that are to be
replaced with the SKU being purchased. When the user completes the purchase,
Google Play cancels the old SKUs and credits the user with the unused value of
their subscription time on a pro-rated basis. Google Play applies this credit
to the new subscription, and does not begin billing the user for the new
subscription until after the credit is used up.</p>

<p>This method was added with version 5 of the in-app billing API. To verify
that the method is reported, send an <code>isBillingSupported</code> AIDL
request.</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> You can only use this method for
subscription purchases. If the passed <code>type</code> parameter is anything
other than <code>"subs"</code>, the method returns
<a href="#billing-codes"><code>BILLING_RESPONSE_RESULT_DEVELOPER_ERROR</code></a>.
Furthermore, the passed SKUs may not include SKUs for seasonal
subscriptions.</p>

<p>
  This method returns a response code integer mapped to the {@code
  RESPONSE_CODE} key, and a {@link android.app.PendingIntent} to launch the
  purchase flow for the in-app subscription mapped to the {@code BUY_INTENT}
  key, as described in <a href=
  "{@docRoot}google/play/billing/billing_integrate.html#purchase">Purchasing an
  Item</a>. When it receives the {@link android.app.PendingIntent}, Google Play
  sends a response {@code Intent} with the data for that purchase order. The
  data that is returned in the response {@code Intent} is summarized in table
  5.
