<h2 id="billing-codes">Server Response Codes</h2>
<p>The following table lists all of the server response codes that are sent from Google Play to
your application. Google Play sends these response codes asynchronously as
<code>response_code</code> extras in the <code>com.android.vending.billing.RESPONSE_CODE</code>
broadcast intent. Your application must handle all of these response codes.</p>

<h3 id="billing-interface">In-app billing Version 2 API reference</h3>

<p>The following section describes the interface for Google Play's In-app Billing service. The
interface is defined in the <code>IMarketBillingService.aidl</code> file, which is included with the
In-app Billing <a
href="{@docRoot}google/play/billing/v2/billing_integrate.html#billing-download">sample
application</a>.</p>
<p>The interface consists of a single request method <code>sendBillingRequest()</code>. This method
takes a single {@link android.os.Bundle} parameter. The Bundle parameter includes several key-value
pairs, which are summarized in table 7.</p>

</table>

<p>The <code>BILLING_REQUEST</code> key can have the following values:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>CHECK_BILLING_SUPPORTED</code>
    <p>This request verifies that the Google Play application supports In-app Billing. You
    usually send this request when your application first starts up. This request is useful if you
    want to enable or disable certain UI features that are relevant only to In-app Billing.</p>
  </li>
  <li><code>REQUEST_PURCHASE</code>
    <p>This request sends a purchase message to the Google Play application and is the foundation
    of In-app Billing. You send this request when a user indicates that he or she wants to purchase
    an item in your application. Google Play then handles the financial transaction by displaying
    the checkout user interface.</p>
  </li>
  <li><code>GET_PURCHASE_INFORMATION</code>
    <p>This request retrieves the details of a purchase state change. A purchase state change can
    occur when a purchase request is billed successfully or when a user cancels a transaction during
    checkout. It can also occur when a previous purchase is refunded. Google Play notifies your
    application when a purchase changes state, so you only need to send this request when there is
    transaction information to retrieve.</p>
  </li>
  <li><code>CONFIRM_NOTIFICATIONS</code>
    <p>This request acknowledges that your application received the details of a purchase state
    change. That is, this message confirms that you sent a <code>GET_PURCHASE_INFORMATION</code>
    request for a given notification and that you received the purchase information for the
    notification.</p>
  </li>
  <li><code>RESTORE_TRANSACTIONS</code>
    <p>This request retrieves a user's transaction status for managed purchases (see <a
    href="{@docRoot}google/play/billing/billing_admin.html#billing-purchase-type">Choosing a
    Purchase Type</a> for more information). You should send this message only when you need to
    retrieve a user's transaction status, which is usually only when your application is reinstalled
    or installed for the first time on a device.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Every In-app Billing request generates a synchronous response. The response is a {@link
android.os.Bundle} and can include one or more of the following keys:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>RESPONSE_CODE</code>
    <p>This key provides status information and error information about a request.</p>
  </li>
  <li><code>PURCHASE_INTENT</code>
    <p>This key provides a {@link android.app.PendingIntent}, which you use to launch the checkout
    activity.</p>
  </li>
  <li><code>REQUEST_ID</code>
    <p>This key provides you with a request identifier, which you can use to match asynchronous
    responses with requests.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Some of these keys are not relevant to certain types of requests. Table 8 shows which keys are
returned for each request type.</p>

<h3 id="billing-intents">In-app billing broadcast intents</h3>

<p>The following section describes the In-app Billing broadcast intents that are sent by the Google
Play application. These broadcast intents inform your application about In-app Billing actions
that have occurred. Your application must implement a {@link android.content.BroadcastReceiver} to
receive these broadcast intents, such as the <code>BillingReceiver</code> that's shown in the in-app
billing <a href="{@docRoot}google/play/billing/v2/billing_integrate.html#billing-download">sample
application</a>.</p>

<h4>com.android.vending.billing.RESPONSE_CODE</h4>

<p>This broadcast intent contains a Google Play response code, and is sent after you make an
In-app Billing request. A server response code can indicate that a billing request was successfully
sent to Google Play or it can indicate that some error occurred during a billing request. This
intent is not used to report any purchase state changes (such as refund or purchase information).
For more information about the response codes that are sent with this response, see <a
href="#billing-codes">Google Play Response Codes for In-app Billing</a>. The sample application
assigns this broadcast intent to a constant named <code>ACTION_RESPONSE_CODE</code>.</p>

<h5>Extras</h5>

<ul type="none">
  <li><code>request_id</code>&mdash;a <code>long</code> representing a request ID. A request ID
  identifies a specific billing request and is returned by Google Play at the time a request is
  made.</li>
  <li><code>response_code</code>&mdash;an <code>int</code> representing the Google Play server
  response code.</li>
</ul>

<h4>com.android.vending.billing.IN_APP_NOTIFY</h4>

<p>This response indicates that a purchase has changed state, which means a purchase succeeded, was
canceled, or was refunded. This response contains one or more notification IDs. Each notification ID
corresponds to a specific server-side message, and each messages contains information about one or
more transactions. After your application receives an <code>IN_APP_NOTIFY</code> broadcast intent,
you send a <code>GET_PURCHASE_INFORMATION</code> request with the notification IDs to retrieve the
message details. The sample application assigns this broadcast intent to a constant named
<code>ACTION_NOTIFY</code>.</p>

<h5>Extras</h5>

<ul type="none">
  <li><code>notification_id</code>&mdash;a <code>String</code> representing the notification ID for
  a given purchase state change. Google Play notifies you when there is a purchase state change
  and the notification includes a unique notification ID. To get the details of the purchase state
  change, you send the notification ID with the <code>GET_PURCHASE_INFORMATION</code> request.</li>
</ul>

<h4>com.android.vending.billing.PURCHASE_STATE_CHANGED</h4>

<p>This broadcast intent contains detailed information about one or more transactions. The
transaction information is contained in a JSON string. The JSON string is signed and the signature
is sent to your application along with the JSON string (unencrypted). To help ensure the security of
your In-app Billing messages, your application can verify the signature of this JSON string. The
sample application assigns this broadcast intent to a constant named
<code>ACTION_PURCHASE_STATE_CHANGED</code>.</p>

<h5>Extras</h5>

<ul type="none">
  <li><code>inapp_signed_data</code>&mdash;a <code>String</code> representing the signed JSON
  string.</li>
  <li><code>inapp_signature</code>&mdash;a <code>String</code> representing the signature.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Your application should map the broadcast intents and extras
to constants that are unique to your application. See the <code>Consts.java</code> file in the
sample application to see how this is done.</p>

<p>The fields in the JSON string are described in the following table (see table 9):</p>

<p class="table-caption"><strong>Table 9.</strong> Description of JSON fields that are returned with
a <code>PURCHASE_STATE_CHANGED</code> intent.</p>

  JSON string so you can verify the integrity of the message.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>notificationId</td>
  <td>A unique identifier that is sent with an <code>IN_APP_NOTIFY</code> broadcast intent. Each
  <code>notificationId</code> corresponds to a specify message that is waiting to be retrieved on
  the Google Play server. Your application sends back the <code>notificationId</code> with the
  <code>GET_PURCHASE_INFORMATION</code> message so Google Play can determine which messages you
  are retrieving.</td>

<!--<h2 id="other-intents">Other Intents</h2> 

<p>The following Intents related to In-app Billing may be useful in your
implemention. </p> -->

<h3 id="http-api">REST API for subscriptions</h3>
<p>Google Play offers an HTTP-based API that you can use to remotely query the validity of a specific subscription at any time or cancel a subscription. The API is designed to be used from your backend servers as a way of securely managing subscriptions, as well as extending and integrating subscriptions with other services. See <a href="{@docRoot}google/play/billing/v2/billing_subscriptions.html#play-dev-api"> Google Play Android Developer API</a> for more information.</p>
