<p>Google Play Licensing is a network-based service that lets an application query a trusted
Google Play licensing server to determine whether the application is licensed to the current
device user. The licensing service is based on the capability of the Google Play licensing server
to determine whether a given user is licensed to use a given application. Google Play considers a
user to be licensed if the user is a recorded purchaser of the application.</p>

<p>The request starts when your application makes a request to a service hosted by
the Google Play client application. The Google Play application then sends a request to
the licensing server and receives the result. The Google Play application sends
the result to your application, which can allow or disallow further use of the
application as needed.</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> If a version of an app is in the alpha or
beta channel, all users who are authorized to download and install that app are
considered to be licensed users of the app. For more information, see <a
href="{@docRoot}distribute/googleplay/developer-console.html#alpha-beta">Alpha
and Beta Testing</a>.</p>

<p class="img-caption"><strong>Figure 1.</strong> Your application initiates a

</div>

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Previously you could test an app by
uploading an unpublished "draft" version. This functionality is no longer
supported; instead, you must publish it to the alpha or beta distribution
channel. For more information, see <a
href="{@docRoot}google/play/billing/billing_testing.html#draft_apps">Draft Apps
are No Longer Supported</a>.

<p>To properly identify the user and determine the license status, the licensing server requires
information about the application and user&mdash;your application and the Google Play client work
together to assemble the information and the Google Play client passes it to the server. </p>

<p>To help you add licensing to your application, the Android SDK provides a downloadable set of
library sources that you can include in your application project: the Google Market
Licensing package. The License Verification Library (LVL) is a library you can add to your
application that
handles all of the licensing-related communication with the Google Play licensing service. With
the LVL added to your application, your application can determine its licensing status for the
current user by simply calling a method and implementing a callback that receives the status
response.</p>

<p>Your application does not query the licensing server
directly, but instead calls the Google Play client over remote IPC to
initiate a license request. In the license request:</p>

<ul>
<li>Your application provides: its package name, a nonce that is later used to
validate any response from the server, and a callback over which the
response can be returned asynchronously.</li>
<li>The Google Play client collects the necessary information about the user and the device,
such as the device's primary Google account username, IMSI, and other
information. It then sends the license check request to the server on behalf of
your application.</li>
<li>The Google Play server evaluates the request using all available information, attempting
to establish the user's identity to a sufficient level of confidence. The server
then checks the user identity against purchase records for your application and
returns a license response, which the Google Play client returns to your
application over the IPC callback.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can choose when, and how often, you want your application to check its
license and you have full control over how it handles the response, verifies the
signed response data, and enforces access controls.</p>

<p>Notice that during a license check, your application does not manage any
network connections or use any licensing related APIs in the Android platform.</p>




<h2 id="Secure">License Responses are Secure</h2>

<p>To ensure the integrity of each license query, the server signs the license
response data using an RSA key pair that is shared exclusively between the Google Play
server and you.</p>

<p>The licensing service generates a single licensing key pair for each
application and exposes the public key in your application's
<strong>Services & APIs</strong> page in the Developer Console. You must copy
the public key from the Developer Console and embed it in your application
source code. The server retains the private key internally and uses it to sign
license responses for the applications you publish with that account.</p>

<p>When your application receives a signed response, it uses the embedded public
key to verify the data. The use of public key cryptography in the licensing
service makes it possible for the application to detect responses that have been
tampered with or that are spoofed.</p>




<h2 id="LVL">Licensing Verification Library</h2>

<p>The Android SDK provides a downloadable package called the Google Market Licensing package,
which includes the License Verification Library (LVL). The LVL greatly simplifies the process of
adding licensing to your application and helps ensure a more secure, robust implementation for your
application. The LVL provides internal classes that handle most of the standard operations of a
license query, such as contacting the Google Play client to initiate a license request and
verifying and validating the responses. It also exposes interfaces that let you easily plug in your
custom code for defining licensing policy and managing access as needed by your application. The key
LVL interfaces are: </p>

<dl>
<dt>{@code Policy}</dt>
  <dd>Your implementation determines whether to allow access to the
application, based on the license response received from the server and any
other data available (such as from a backend server associated with your
application). The implementation can evaluate the various fields of the license
response and apply other constraints, if needed. The implementation also lets
you manage the handling of license checks that result in errors, such as network
errors.</dd>

<dt>{@code LicenseCheckerCallback}</dt>
  <dd>Your implementation manages access to the
application, based on the result of the {@code Policy} object's handling of the license
response. Your implementation can manage access in any way needed, including
displaying the license result in the UI or directing the user to purchase the
application (if not currently licensed).</dd>
</dl>


<p>To help you get started with a {@code Policy}, the LVL provides two fully complete
{@code Policy} implementations that you can use without modification or adapt to your
needs:</p>

<dl>
<dt><a href="adding-licensing.html#ServerManagedPolicy">{@code ServerManagedPolicy}</a></dt>
  <dd>A flexible {@code Policy}
that uses settings provided by the licensing server to manage response caching
and access to the application while the device is offline (such as when the
user is on an airplane). For most applications, the use of
{@code ServerManagedPolicy} is highly recommended.</dd>

<dt><a href="adding-licensing.html#StrictPolicy">{@code StrictPolicy}</a></dt>
  <dd>A restrictive {@code Policy} that
does not cache any response data and allows the application access <em>only</em>
when the server returns a licensed response.</dd>
</dl>

<p>The LVL is available as a downloadable package of the Android SDK. The
package includes both the LVL itself and an example application that shows how
the library should be integrated with your application and how your application
should manage response data, UI interaction, and error conditions. </p>

<p>The LVL sources are provided as an Android <em>library project</em>, which
means that you can maintain a single set of library sources and share them
across multiple applications. A full test environment is also available through
the SDK, so you can develop and test the licensing implementation in your
applications before publishing them, even if you don't have access to a
physical device.</p>




<h2 id="Reqs">Requirements and Limitations</h2>

<p>Google Play Licensing is designed to let you apply license controls to
applications that you publish through Google Play. The service is not
designed to let you control access to applications that are not published
through Google Play or that are run on devices that do not offer the Google
Play client. </p>

<p>Here are some points to keep in mind as you implement licensing in your
application: </p>

<ul>
<li>An application can use the service only if the Google Play client is
installed on its host device and the device is running Android 1.5 (API level 3) or higher.</li>
<li>To complete a license check, the licensing server must be accessible over
the network. You can implement license caching behaviors to manage access to your application when
there is no network connectivity. </li>
<li>The security of your application's licensing controls ultimately relies on
the design of your implementation itself. The service provides the building
blocks that let you securely check licensing, but the actual enforcement and
handling of the license are factors are up to you. By following the best
practices in the following documents, you can help ensure that your implementation will be
secure.</li>
<li>Adding licensing to an application does not affect the way the application
functions when run on a device that does not offer Google Play.</li>
<li>You can implement licensing controls for a free app, but only if you're using the service to
provide <a
href="{@docRoot}google/play/expansion-files.html">APK expansion files</a>.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="CopyProtection">Replacement for Copy Protection</h2>

<p>Google Play Licensing is a flexible, secure mechanism for controlling
access to your applications. It effectively replaces the Copy Protection
mechanism (no longer supported) that was previously offered on Google Play and
gives you wider distribution potential for your applications. </p>

<p>Licensing lets you move to a license-based model that is enforceable on
all devices that have access to Google Play. Access is not bound to the
characteristics of the host device, but to your
application on Google Play (through the app's public key) and the
licensing policy that you define. Your application can be installed and
managed on any device on any storage, including SD card.</p>

<p>Although no license mechanism can completely prevent all unauthorized use,
the licensing service lets you control access for most types of normal usage,
across all compatible devices, locked or unlocked.</p>
