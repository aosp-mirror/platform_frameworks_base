<p>The Android Support Library package contains several libraries that can be included
  in your application. Each of these libraries supports a specific range of Android platform
  versions and set of features.</p>

<p>This guide explains the important features and version support provided by the Support
  Libraries to help you decide which of them you should include in your application. In general,
  we recommend including the <a href="#v4">v4 support</a> and <a href="#v7-appcompat">v7
  appcompat</a> libraries, because they support a wide range of
  Android versions and provide APIs for recommended user interface patterns.</p>

<p>In order to use any of the following libraries, you must download the library files to your
  Android SDK installation. Follow the directions for downloading the Support Libraries in
  <a href="{@docRoot}tools/support-library/setup.html#download">Support Library Setup</a> to
  complete this step. You must take additional steps to include a specific Support Library in
  your application. See the end of each library section below for important information on how to
  include the library in your application.</p>


<h2 id="v4">v4 Support Library</h2>

<p>This library is designed to be used with Android 1.6 (API level 4) and higher. It includes the
  largest set of APIs compared to the other libraries, including support for application components,

on any app. These cards are useful for material design
implementations, and are used extensively in layouts for TV apps.</p>

<p>This library is located in the
{@code &lt;sdk&gt;/extras/android/support/v7/cardview/} directory after you
download the Android Support Libraries. The library contains user interface

android.support.v7.media.MediaRouteProvider}, and related media classes that
support <a href="https://developers.google.com/cast/docs/android_sender">Google Cast</a>. </p>

<p>In general, the APIs in the v7 mediarouter library provide a means of
controlling the routing of media channels and streams from the current device to
external screens, speakers, and other destination devices. The library includes
APIs for publishing app-specific media route providers, for discovering and
selecting destination devices, for checking media status, and more. For detailed
information about the v7 mediarouter library APIs, see the
{@link android.support.v7.media android.support.v7.media} package in the API
reference.</p>

<p>The v7 mediarouter library is located in the
<code>&lt;sdk&gt;/extras/android/support/v7/mediarouter/</code> directory after
you download the Android Support Library. It's provided as a library project
with a dependency on the v7 appcompat library, so you'll need to include both
libraries in your build path when setting up your project. For more information
on how to set up your project, follow the instructions in <a
href="{@docRoot}tools/support-library/setup.html#libs-with-res">Adding libraries
with resources</a>. If you are developing in Eclipse/ADT, make sure to include
both the <code>android-support-v7-mediarouter.jar</code> and
<code>android-support-v7-appcompat.jar</code> files.</p>

<p>If you are using Android Studio, all you need to do is specify the Gradle build
script dependency identifier <code>com.android.support:support-v7-mediarouter:&lt;revision&gt;</code>,
where "&lt;revision&gt;" is the minimum revision at which the library is available. For example:</p>

<pre>
com.android.support:mediarouter-v7:21.0.0
</pre>

<p class="caution">The v7 mediarouter library APIs introduced in Support Library
r18 are subject to change in later revisions of the Support Library. At this
time, we recommend using the library only in connection with <a
href="https://developers.google.com/cast/docs/android_sender">Google Cast</a>. </p>

<h3 id="v7-palette">v7 palette library</h3>

<p>The v7 palette support library includes the
{@link android.support.v7.graphics.Palette} class, which lets you extract
prominent colors from an image. For example, a music app could use a
{@link android.support.v7.graphics.Palette} object to extract the major colors
from an album cover, and use those colors to build a color-coordinated song
title card.</p>

<p>This library is located in the
{@code &lt;sdk&gt;/extras/android/support/v7/palette/} directory after
  you download the Android Support Libraries. The library does not contain user interface
  resources. To include it in your application project, follow the instructions for
  <a href="{@docRoot}tools/support-library/setup.html#libs-without-res">Adding libraries without
  resources</a>.</p>

<p>The Gradle build script dependency identifier for this library is as follows:</p>

<pre>
com.android.support:palette-v7:21.0.0
</pre>



<h3 id="v7-recyclerview">v7 recyclerview library</h3>

class. This class provides support for the
<a href="{@docRoot}training/material/lists-cards.jd#RecyclerView">RecyclerView
widget</a>, a view for efficiently displaying large data sets by providing a
limited window of data items.</p>

<p>This library is located in the
{@code &lt;sdk&gt;/extras/android/support/v7/recyclerview/} directory after you
download the Android Support Libraries. The library contains user interface
resources. To include it in your application project, follow the instructions
for <a href="{@docRoot}tools/support-library/setup.html#libs-with-res">Adding
libraries with resources</a>.</p>

<p>The Gradle build script dependency identifier for this library is as follows:</p>

<pre>
com.android.support:recyclerview-v7:21.0.0
</pre>



<h2 id="v8">v8 Support Library</h2>

<p>This library is designed to be used with Android (API level 8) and higher. It adds support for
  the <a href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/renderscript/compute.html">RenderScript</a> computation
  framework. These APIs are included in the {@link android.support.v8.renderscript} package. You
  should be aware that the steps for including these APIs in your application is <em>very
  different</em> from other support library APIs. For more information about using these APIs
  in your application, see the
  <a href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/renderscript/compute.html#access-rs-apis">RenderScript</a>
  developer guide.</p>

<p class="note">
  <strong>Note:</strong> Use of RenderScript with the support library is supported with the Android
  Eclipse plugin and Ant build tools. It is <em>not currently</em> supported with Android Studio or
  Gradle-based builds.
</p>


<h2 id="v13">v13 Support Library</h2>

<p>This library is designed to be used for Android 3.2 (API level 13) and higher. It adds support
  for the <a href="{@docRoot}guide/components/fragments.html">Fragment</a> user interface pattern
  with the ({@link android.support.v13.app.FragmentCompat}) class and additional fragment support
  classes. For more information about fragments, see the
  <a href="{@docRoot}guide/components/fragments.html">Fragments</a> developer guide. For detailed
  information about the v13 Support Library APIs, see the {@link android.support.v13.app
  android.support.v13} package in the API reference.
</p>

<p>This library is located in the {@code &lt;sdk&gt;/extras/android/support/v13/} directory after

  resources</a>.</p>

<p>The Gradle build script dependency identifier for this library is as follows:</p>

<pre>
com.android.support:support-v13:18.0.0
</pre>



<h2 id="v17-leanback">v17 Leanback Library</h2>

<p>The {@link android.support.v17.leanback} package provides APIs to support
  building user interfaces
  on TV devices. It provides a number of important widgets for TV apps. Some of the notable classes include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>{@link android.support.v17.leanback.app.BrowseFragment} - A fragment for
    creating a primary layout for browsing categories and rows of media
    items.</li>

    subclass of {@link android.support.v17.leanback.app.DetailsFragment} for
    displaying playback controls and related content.</li>
  <li>{@link android.support.v17.leanback.app.SearchFragment} - A fragment to
    handle searches. The fragment receives the user's search request and passes
    it to the application-provided {@link
    android.support.v17.leanback.app.SearchFragment.SearchResultProvider
    SearchResultProvider}. The {@link
    android.support.v17.leanback.app.SearchFragment.SearchResultProvider
    SearchResultProvider} returns the search results to the
    {@link android.support.v17.leanback.app.SearchFragment}, which renders them
    into a {@link android.support.v17.leanback.app.RowsFragment}.</li>
</ul>
