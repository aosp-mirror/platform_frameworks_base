    <img src="{@docRoot}assets/images/styles/disclosure_up.png" class="toggle-content-img"
      alt=""/>Android Studio v2.1.0</a> <em>(April 2016)</em>
  </p>
  <div class="toggle-content-toggleme">

<p>The primary changes in this update provide support for development with the
<a href="{@docRoot}preview/index.html">Android N Preview</a>.</p>

<p>The Android N platform adds support for <a
href="{@docRoot}preview/j8-jack.html">Java 8 language features</a>, which
require a new experimental compiler called Jack. The latest version of Jack is
currently supported only in Android Studio 2.1. So if you want to use Java 8
language features, you need to use Android Studio 2.1 to build your app.</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> <a
href="{@docRoot}tools/building/building-studio.html#instant-run">Instant Run</a>
is disabled when you enable the Jack compiler because they currently are not
compatible.</p>

<p>Although Android Studio 2.1 is now stable, the Jack compiler is still
experimental and you must enable it with <a
href="{@docRoot}preview/j8-jack.html#configuration">the <code>jackOptions</code>
property</a> in your <code>build.gradle</code> file.</p>

<p>Other than the changes to support the N Preview, Android Studio 2.1
includes minor bug fixes and the following enhancements:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The Java-aware C++ debugger is now enabled by default when you're
using an N device or emulator and select <strong>Native</strong> debugger mode
(in the <strong>Debugger</strong> tab for your run/debug configuration).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For other build enhancements, including incremental Java compilation
    and dexing-in-process,update your <a
href="{@docRoot}tools/revisions/gradle-plugin.html">Android Plugin for
Gradle</a> to version 2.1.0.</p>
  </div>

  </p>

  <div class="toggle-content-toggleme">

    <p class="note">
      <strong>Note:</strong> If you are developing for the N Developer Preview, you
      should use Android Studio 2.1 Preview. Android Studio 2.0 does not support
      all the features required to target the N Preview. To learn more, read about
      how to properly <a href="{@docRoot}preview/setup-sdk.html">set up your
      developer environment</a> for the N Preview.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Instant Run</strong>:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Android Studio now deploys clean builds faster than ever before.
      Additionally, pushing incremental code changes to the emulator or a physical
      device is now almost instantaneous. Review your updates without redeploying a
      new debug build or, in many cases, without restarting the app.
      </li>

      <li>Instant Run supports pushing the following changes to a running app:
        <ul>
          <li>Changes to the implementation of an existing instance method or
          static method
          </li>

          <li>Changes to an existing app resource
          </li>

          <li>Changes to structural code, such as a method signature or a static
          field (requires a target device running API level 21 or higher).
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>Read the documentation to learn more <a href=
      "{@docRoot}tools/building/building-studio.html#instant-run">about Instant
      Run</a>.
        <p class="note">
          <strong>Note:</strong> Instant Run is supported only when you deploy the
          debug build variant, use <a href=
          "{@docRoot}tools/revisions/gradle-plugin.html#revisions">Android Plugin for
          Gradle version 2.0.0</a> or higher, and configure your app's module-level
          <code>build.gradle</code> file for <code>minSdkVersion 15</code> or higher.
          For the best performance, configure your app for <code>minSdkVersion
          21</code> or higher.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

<p><strong>New additions to Lint:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Inspection of {@code switch} statements using {@link
    android.support.annotation.IntDef @IntDef} annotated integers to make sure
    all constants are handled. To quickly add any missing statements, use the the
    intention action drop-down menu and select <b>Add Missing @IntDef
    Constants</b>.
    </li>

    <li>Flags for incorrect attempts to use string interpolation to insert
    version numbers in the {@code build.gradle} file.
    </li>

    <li>Flags for anonymous classes that extend the {@link android.app.Fragment
    Fragment} class.
    </li>

    <li>Flags for native code in unsafe locations, such as the {@code res/} and {@code
    asset/} folders. This flag encourages storing native code in the {@code libs/}
    folder, which is then securely packaged into the application’s {@code
    data/app-lib/} folder at install time. <a class="external-link" href=
    "https://android-review.googlesource.com/#/c/169950/">AOSP: #169950</a>
    </li>

    <li>Flags for unsafe calls to {@link java.lang.Runtime#load(java.lang.String)
    Runtime.load()} and {@link java.lang.System#load(java.lang.String)
    System.load()} calls. <a class="external-link" href=
    "https://android-review.googlesource.com/#/c/179980/">AOSP: #179980</a>
    </li>

    <li>Find and remove any unused resources by selecting <b>Refactor &gt; Remove
    Unused Resources</b> from the menu bar. Unused resource detection now
    supports resources only referenced by unused resources, references in raw
    files such as {@code .html} image references, and {@code tools:keep} and
    {@code tools:discard} attributes used by the Gradle resource shrinker, while
    considering inactive source sets (such as resources used in other build
    flavors) and properly handling static field imports.
    </li>

    <li>Checks that implicit API references are supported on all platforms
    targeted by {@code minSdkVersion}.
    </li>

    <li>Flags improper usage of {@link android.support.v7.widget.RecyclerView}
    and {@link android.os.Parcelable}.
    </li>

    <li>{@link android.support.annotation.IntDef @IntDef}, {@link
    android.support.annotation.IntRange @IntRange}, and {@link
    android.support.annotation.Size @Size} inspections are now also checked for
    {@code int} arrays and varargs.
    </li>
  </ul>

<p><strong>Additional Improvements</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Optimized for Android Emulator 2.0, which is faster than ever before,
      supports a wider range of virtual devices, and features a drastically
      improved UI. To learn more about the new emulator, read the <a href=
      "{@docRoot}tools/sdk/tools-notes.html#notes">SDK Tools release notes</a>.
      </li>

      <li>Improvements to the <a href=
      "{@docRoot}tools/devices/managing-avds.html">Android Virtual Device
      Manager</a>:
        <ul>
          <li>System images are now categorized under the following tabs:
          <em>Recommended</em>, <em>x86</em>, and <em>Other</em>.
          </li>

          <li>Under advanced settings, you can enable multi-core support and
          specify the number of cores the emulator can use.
          </li>

          <li>Under advanced settings, you can determine how graphics are rendered
          on the emulator by selecting one of the following options:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Hardware:</strong> use you computer's graphics card for
                faster rendering.
              </li>

              <li>
                <strong>Software:</strong> use software-based rendering.
              </li>

              <li>
                <strong>Auto:</strong> let the emulator decide the best option. This
                is the default setting.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>Improved AAPT packaging times by specifying deploy target before the app
      is built. This allows Android Studio to efficiently package only the
      resources required by the specified device.
      </li>

      <li>Added Cloud Test Lab integration to provide on-demand app testing with
      the convenience and scalability of a cloud service. Learn more about how you
      can <a href="{@docRoot}training/testing/start/index.html#run-ctl">use Cloud
      Test Lab with Android Studio</a>.
      </li>

      <li>Added a preview of the new <a class="external-link" href=
      "//tools.android.com/tech-docs/gpu-profiler">GPU Debugger</a>. For graphics
      intensive applications, you can now visually step through your OpenGL ES code
      to optimize your app or game.
      </li>

      <li>Added Google App Indexing Test. Add support for URLs, app
      indexing, and search functionality to your apps to help drive more
      traffic to your app, discover which app content is used most, and attract
      new users. Test and validate URLs in your app all within Android
      Studio. See <a href=
      "{@docRoot}tools/help/app-link-indexing.html">Supporting URLs and App Indexing in Android Studio</a>.
      </li>

      <li>Upgrades from the latest IntelliJ 15 release, including improved code
      analysis and performance. See <a class="external-link" href=
      "https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/whatsnew">What's New in IntelliJ</a> for a
      complete description of the new features and enhancements.
      </li>

      <li>XML editor auto-complete now adds quotations marks when completing
      attributes. To check if this option is enabled, open the <b>Setting</b> or
      <b>Preferences</b> dialogue, navigate to <b>Editor &gt; General &gt; Smart
      Keys</b>, and check the box next to <b>Add quotes for attribute value on
      attribute completion</b>. <a class="external-link" href=
      "//b.android.com/195113">Issue: 195113</a>
      </li>

      <li>The XML editor now supports code completion for <a href=
      "{@docRoot}tools/data-binding/guide.html#layout_details">data binding</a>
      expressions.
      </li>

  </p>
  <div class="toggle-content-toggleme">
    <p>Fixes and enhancements:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Added new Memory Monitor analysis abilities to Android Monitor. When you view an HPROF file
      captured from this monitor, the display is now more helpful so you can more quickly locate
      problems, such as memory leaks. To use this monitor, click <strong>Android Monitor</strong> at
      the bottom of the main window. In Android Monitor, click the <strong>Memory</strong> tab. While
      the monitor is running, click the <strong>Dump Java Heap</strong> icon, and then click
      <strong>Captures</strong> in the main window and double-click the file to view it. Click
      <em>Capture Analysis</em> on the right. (The
      Android Device Monitor can't be running at the same time as Android Monitor.)</li>
    <li>Added new deep link and app link support. The Code Editor can automatically create an
      intent filter for deep linking in the <code>AndroidManifest.xml</code> file. It can also
      generate code to help you integrate with the
      <a href="http://developers.google.com/app-indexing/android/publish" class="external-link">App Indexing API</a>
      in an activity in a Java file. A deep link testing feature
      helps you verify that a specified deep link can launch an app. In the <strong>General</strong>
      tab of the <em>Run/Debug Configurations</em> dialog, you can specify deep link launch
      options. You can also test App Indexing API calls in an activity by using the Android Monitor
      <strong>logcat</strong> display. The Android <code>lint</code> tool now has warnings for
      certain issues involving deep links and the App Indexing API.
    </li>
     <li>Added the ability to use short names when code-completing custom views in the Code Editor.
    </li>
    <li>Added support for more {@link android.graphics.drawable.VectorDrawable} elements to
      <a href="{@docRoot}tools/help/vector-asset-studio.html">Vector Asset Studio</a>
      for backward-compatibility. Vector Asset Studio can use these elements to convert vector
      drawables into PNG raster images to use with Android 4.4 (API level 20) and lower.
    </li>
    <li>Added new <code>lint</code> checks for Android TV and Android Auto to give you
      immediate, actionable feedback in Android Studio, along with several quick fixes. For example,
      for Android TV, it can report and provide a quick fix for permissions, unsupported hardware,
      <code>uses-feature</code> element, and missing banner issues. For Android Auto, it can
      validate the correct usage in the descriptor file referred from your
      <code>AndroidManifest.xml</code> file, report if there isn't an intent filter for the
      <code>MediaBrowserService</code> class, and identify certain voice actions issues.
      </li>
    <li>Added new <code>lint</code> checks for insecure broadcast receivers,
    <code>SSLCertificateSocketFactory</code> and <code>HostnameVerifier</code> class uses, and
    <code>File.setReadable()</code> and <code>File.setWritable()</code> calls. It also detects
    invalid manifest resource lookups, especially for resources that vary by configuration.
    </li>
    <li>Fixed a number of stability issues.

  </p>

  <div class="toggle-content-toggleme">
  <ul>
    <li>Merged in the latest IntelliJ codebase changes. Includes fixes for issues reported by Studio users such as tweaks to Linux font sizes and font rendering.</li>
    <li>Android Gradle plug-in updated to 0.5.0.
      <p class="caution"><strong>Caution:</strong> This new version is not backwards compatible.
      When opening a project that uses an older version of the plug-in, Studio will show an error
      stating <strong>Gradle &lt;project_name&gt; project refresh failed.</strong></p>
      <p>The updated Gradle plug-in includes the following changes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Fixed IDE model to contain the output file even if it's customized through the DSL. Also
        fixed the DSL to get/set the output file on the variant object so that it's not necessary to
        use <code>variant.packageApplication or variant.zipAlign</code></li>
        <li>Fixed dependency resolution so that we resolved the combination of (default config,
        build types, flavor(s)) together instead of separately.</li>
        <li>Fixed dependency for tests of library project to properly include all the dependencies
        of the library itself.</li>
        <li>Fixed case where two dependencies have the same leaf name.</li>
        <li>Fixed issue where Proguard rules file cannot be applied on flavors.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>All Gradle plugin release notes are available are here: <a href=
      "http://tools.android.com/tech-docs/new-build-system"
      >http://tools.android.com/tech-docs/new-build-system</a>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Gradle errors from aapt no longer point to merged output files in the build/ folder, they
    point back to the real source locations.</li>
    <li>Parallel Builds. It's now possible to use Gradle's parallel builds. Please be aware that
    parallel builds are in "incubation" (see <a
    href="http://www.gradle.org/docs/current/userguide/gradle_command_line.html">Gradle's
    documentation</a>.) This feature is off by default. To enable it, go to
    <strong>Preferences</strong> &gt; <strong>Compiler</strong> and check the box <em>Compile
    independent modules in parallel</em>.</li>
    <li>Further work on the new resource repository used for layout rendering, resource
    folding in the editor, and more:
      <ul>
      <li>Basic support for .aar library dependencies (e.g. using a library without a local copy of
      the sources). Still not working for resource XML validation and navigation in source editors.
      </li>
      <li>Cycle detection in resource references.</li>
      <li>Quick Documentation (F1), which can show all translations of the string under the caret,
      will now also show all resource overlays from the various Gradle flavors and build types, as
      well as libraries. They are listed in reverse resource overlay order, with strikethrough on
      the versions of the string that are masked.</li>
      <li>Fixes to handle updating the merged resources when the set of module dependencies
      change.</li>
      <li>XML rendering fixes to properly handle character entity declarations and XML and unicode
      escapes.</li>
      </ul>
    <li>Save screenshot support for the layout preview and layout editor windows.</li>
    <li>Template bug fixes.</li>
    <li>Lint bug fixes.</li>
    <li>Various fixes for crash reports. Thank you, and keep filing crash reports!</li>
