@jd:body

<p>SDK Tools is a downloadable component for the Android SDK. It includes the
complete set of development and debugging tools for the Android SDK.</p>

<p>If you are new to the Android SDK, the <a
href="{@docRoot}sdk/index.html">SDK starter package</a> installs the
latest revision of the SDK Tools in the <code>&lt;sdk&gt;/tools</code> directory.</p>

<p>If you are already using the SDK and you want to update to the latest version
of the SDK Tools, use the <em>Android SDK Manager</em> to get the
update, rather than downloading a new SDK starter package. For more information
about how to update, see <a
href="{@docRoot}sdk/exploring.html#UpdatingComponents">Exploring the SDK</a>.</p>


<h2 id="notes">Revisions</h2>

<p>The sections below provide notes about successive releases of
the SDK Tools, as denoted by revision number. To determine what revision of the SDK
Tools you are using, refer to the "Installed Packages" listing in the Android SDK Manager. </p>

<p>For a summary of all known issues in SDK Tools, see <a
href="http://tools.android.com/knownissues">http://tools.android.com/knownissues</a>.</p>

    <dt>General Notes:</dt>
    <dd>
      <ul>
        <li>Build
          <ul>
            <li>Updated build to detect and handle package name conflicts between an application and
              the libraries it depends on. Libraries cannot share package names unless all of them
              share the same package name.
              (<a href="http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=40152">Issue 40152</a>,
               <a href="http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=40273">Issue 40273</a>)
            </li>
            <li>Added a flag to disable dex merging to deal with cases where merging could generate
              a broken dex file. If this happens to your project, add the following setting to your
              {@code project.properties} file: {@code dex.disable.merger=true} This setting
              causes the build system to revert to the older, slower dex processing that does not
              pre-dex libraries.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Renderscript
          <ul>
            <li>Added support for
              <a href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/renderscript/compute.html#filterscript">Filterscript</a>
              compilation.</li>
            <li>Added new project setting to control the Renderscript compilation target separately
              from an Android project. Adding the following line to a {@code project.properties}
              file causes Renderscript code to be compiled for Android API Level 17, while the
              containing application can target a different (lower) API level:
              <pre>renderscript.target = 17</pre>
              Previously, the Renderscript compilation target was tied to the
              {@code android:minSdkVersion} setting in the manifest.

      <ul>
        <li>Build System
          <ul>
            <li>Added a flag that sets <em>jumbo mode</em> for DEX files, which allows a larger
              number of strings in the DEX files. Enable this mode by adding the following line to
              the {@code project.properties} file of your project:
              <pre>set dex.force.jumbo=true</pre></li>
            <li>Improved the build time by pre-dexing libraries (both JAR files and library
              projects).</li>
            <li>Updated the build to generate {@code R} resource classes for library projects
              with only the IDs needed by the libraries, reducing the risk of hitting DEX file
              limits for fields and methods.</li>

              chooser, go to declaration) properly handle library project resources.</li>

        </li>
        <li>Lint
          <ul>
            <li>Added over 25 new lint rules for resources, locale settings, layout
              files, incorrect use of {@link android.util.SparseArray} and
              {@link android.os.PowerManager.WakeLock} and manifest issues.</li>
            <li>Updated reporting to include errors in library projects if the library project is
              in the list of projects to be checked.</li>
            <li>Added a new {@code lint} target to the Ant build system for easier
              integration with continuous build systems.</li>
            <li>Added new {@code --sources} and {@code --classpath} arguments to point to sources
              with different directory structures.</li>

        <li>Android Virtual Devices (AVD)
          <ul>
            <li>Added new <strong>Device Definitions</strong> tab in the AVD Manager for configuring
              standard size and Nexus virtual devices.</li>
            <li>Improved emulators so that they launch with a skin that is dynamically generated and
              reflects the actual hardware configured in the AVD Manager.</li>
            <li>Improved support for developing Android apps on MIPS-based devices with new MIPS
              System Images for Android Virtual Devices.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Added {@code jobb} tool for creating and encrypting

      <ul>
        <li>Added new Device Monitor application, grouping Android debugging tools into a
single application, including ddms, traceview, hierarchyviewer and Tracer for GLES. (<a

        <li>Added new System Trace new tool for tracing Android system activity. This tool allow you
to capture a slice of system activity, plus additional information tagged from the <strong>Settings
&gt; Developer Options &gt; Monitoring: Enable traces</strong> or with specific calls added to your
application code.</li>

        <li>Build System
          <ul>
            <li>Added automatic merging of library project manifest files into the including
project's manifest. Enable this feature with the {@code manifestmerger.enabled} property.</li>
            <li>Added automatic ProGuard support for the {@code aapt -G} flag. This change causes
the build system to generate a temporary ProGuard {@code keep-rules} file containing classes that
are referenced from XML files (such as custom views) and pass this to ProGuard at shrink time. This
can make the resulting APK much smaller when using just a small portion of a large library project
(such as the Android Support library), since the catch-all rules to keep all custom views from the
default ProGuard configuration file have also been removed.</li>
            <li>Added two ProGuard configuration files for use in projects: {@code
proguard-android-optimize.txt} which enables optimizations and {@code proguard-android.txt} which
disables them.</li>

API Level 15, Revision 3 or later system image.
(<a href="{@docRoot}tools/devices/emulator.html#accel-graphics">more info</a>)
            </li>
            <li>Added support for running Android x86 system images in virtualization mode on
Windows and Mac OS X.

            </li>
            <li>Added experimental support for multi-touch input by enabing the emulator to receive
              touch input from a USB-tethered physical Android device.
              (<a href="http://tools.android.com/tips/hardware-emulation">more info</a>)</li>
          </ul>

        <li>Added viewing of live detailed network usage of an app in DDMS. (<a
    href="http://tools.android.com/recent/detailednetworkusageinddms">more info</a>)</li>
        <li>ProGuard
          <ul>
            <li>Updated the bundled ProGuard tool to version 4.7. In addition to many new features,
this update fixes the {@code Conversion to Dalvik format failed with error 1} error some users have
experienced.</li>
            <li>Updated the default {@code proguard.cfg} file with better default flags for
              Android.</li>
            <li>Split the ProGuard configuration file has been in half, with project specific flags
kept in project and the generic Android flags distributed (and updated) with the tools
themselves.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Build
          <ul>
            <li>Added a feature that allows you to run some code only in debug mode. Builds now
generate a class called {@code BuildConfig} containing a {@code DEBUG} constant that is
automatically set according to your build type. You can check the ({@code BuildConfig.DEBUG})
constant in your code to run debug-only functions.</li>
            <li>Fixed issue when a project and its libraries include the same jar file in their libs
              folder. (<a href="http://tools.android.com/recent/dealingwithdependenciesinandroidprojects">more
              info</a>)</li>
            <li>Added support for custom views with custom attributes in libraries. Layouts using
custom attributes must use the namespace URI {@code http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto} instead
of the URI that includes the app package name. This URI is replaced with the app specific one at
build time.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Lint
          <ul>
            <li>Updated Lint to check Android application code. Lint rules which previously
performed pattern based searches in the application code (such as the unused resource check) have
been rewritten to use the more accurate Java-style parse trees.</li>
            <li>Added support for checking library projects. This change means that rules such as
the unused resource check properly handle resources declared in a library project and referenced in
a downstream project.</li>
            <li>Added ability to suppress Lint warnings in Java code with the new
{@code @SuppressLint} annotation, and in XML files with the new tools: namespace and
ignore attribute. (<a
    href="http://tools.android.com/recent/ignoringlintwarnings">more info</a>)</li>
            <li>New Lint checks:
              <ul>
                <li>Added check for Android API calls that require a version of Android higher than
                  the minimum supported version. You can use the new {@code @TargetApi} annotation
                  to suppress warnings when the code is wrapped in a system version condition.
                  (<a href="http://tools.android.com/recent/lintapicheck">more info</a>)</li>
                <li>Added over 20 new Lint rules, including checks for

<dt>General notes:</dt>

<ul>
<li>All SDK platforms now support Library Projects.</li>
<li>Support for a true debug build. Developers no longer need to add the
<code>android:debuggable</code> attribute to the
<code>&lt;application&gt;</code> tag in the manifest &mdash; the build tools add
the attribute automatically. In Eclipse/ADT, all incremental builds are assumed
to be debug builds, so the tools insert <code>android:debuggable="true"</code>.
When exporting a signed release build, the tools do not add the attribute. In
Ant, a <code>ant debug</code> command automatically inserts the
<code>android:debuggable="true"</code> attribute, while <code>ant release</code>
does not. If <code>android:debuggable="true"</code> is manually set, then
<code>ant release</code> will actually do a debug build, rather than a release
build.</li>
<li>Automatic ProGuard support in release builds. Developers generate a ProGuard
configuration file using the <code>android</code> tool &mdash; the build tools
then automatically run ProGuard against the project sources during the build.
For more information, see the <a
href="{@docRoot}tools/help/proguard.html">ProGuard</a>
documentation. </li>
<li>New overridable Ant javac properties: <code>java.encoding</code>,
<code>java.source</code>, and <code>java.target</code> (default values are
"ascii", "1.5", and "1.5", respectively).</li>

<p>The SDK Tools now support the use of <em>library projects</em> during
development, a capability that lets you store shared Android application
code and resources in a separate development project. You can then reference the
library project from other Android projects and, at build time, the tools
compile the shared code and resources as part of the dependent applications.
More information about this feature is available in the <a
href="{@docRoot}tools/projects/index.html#LibraryProjects">Creating and Managing Projects</a> document.</p>
<p>If you are developing in Eclipse, <a href="eclipse-adt.html">ADT</a>
provides the equivalent library project support.</p>
