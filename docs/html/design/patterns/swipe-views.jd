@jd:body

<p>Efficient navigation is one of the cornerstones of a well-designed app. While apps are generally
built in a hierarchical fashion, there are instances where horizontal navigation can flatten
vertical hierarchies and make access to related data items faster and more enjoyable. Swipe views
allow the user to efficiently move from item to item using a simple gesture and thereby make
browsing and consuming data a more fluent experience.</p>
<h2 id="detail-views">Swiping Between Detail Views</h2>

<p>An app's data is often organized in a master/detail relationship: The user can view a list of
related data items, such as images, chats, or emails, and then pick one of the items to see the
detail contents in a separate screen.</p>

  Master (left) and detail (right) views.
</div>

<p>On a phone, since the master and detail are on separate screens, this typically requires the user to
jump back and forth between the list and the detail view, aka "pogo-sticking".</p>
<p>In cases where users will want to view multiple detail items in succession, avoid pogo-sticking by
using the swipe gesture to navigate to the next/previous detail view.</p>

  Navigating between consecutive Email messages using the swipe gesture. If a view contains content that exceeds the width of the screen such as a wide Email message, make sure the user's initial swipes will scroll horizontally within the view. Once the end of the content is reached, an additional swipe should navigate to the next view. In addition, support the use of edge swipes to immediately navigate between views when content scrolls horizontally.

    <h2 id="checklist">Checklist</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
      <p>Use swipe to quickly navigate between detail views or tabs.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>Transition between the views as the user performs the swipe gesture. Do not wait for the
        gesture to complete and then transition between views.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>If you used buttons in the past for previous/next navigation, replace them with
        the swipe gesture.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>Consider adding contextual information in your detail view that informs the user about the
        relative list position of the currently visible item.</p>
      </li>
