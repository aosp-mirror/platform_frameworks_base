page.title=Text Fields
@jd:body

<p>Text fields allow the user to type text into your app. They can be either single line or multi-line.
Touching a text field places the cursor and automatically displays the keyboard. In addition to
typing, text fields allow for a variety of other activities, such as text selection (cut, copy,
paste) and data lookup via auto-completion.</p>

<h4>Single line and multi line</h4>
<p>Single-line fields automatically scroll their content to the left as the text input cursor reaches
the right edge of the input field. Multi-line text fields automatically break to a new line for
overflow text and scroll vertically when the cursor reaches the lower edge.</p>

<h4>Text field types</h4>
<p>Text fields can have different types, such as number, message, or email address. The type determines
what kind of characters are allowed inside the field, and may prompt the virtual keyboard to
optimize its layout for frequently used characters.</p>

<h4>Auto-complete text fields</h4>
<p>Use auto-complete text fields to present real-time completions or search results in popups, so users
can enter information more accurately and efficiently.</p>
