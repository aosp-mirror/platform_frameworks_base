<p>A button consists of text and/or an image that clearly communicates what action will occur when the
user touches it. Android supports two different types of buttons: <em>basic buttons</em> and <em>borderless
buttons</em>. Both can contain text labels and/or images.</p>

<h2 id="basic">Basic Buttons</h2>

<p>Basic buttons are traditional buttons with borders and background. Android supports two styles for
basic buttons: default and small. Default buttons have slightly larger font size and are optimized
for display outside of form content. Small buttons are intended for display alongside other content.
They have a smaller font and smaller minimum height. Use small buttons in forms where they need to
align with other UI elements.</p>

<h2 id="borderless">Borderless Buttons</h2>

<p>Borderless buttons resemble basic buttons except that they have no borders or background. You can
use borderless buttons with both icons and text. Borderless buttons are visually more lightweight
than basic buttons and integrate nicely with other content.</p>
