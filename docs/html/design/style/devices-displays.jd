<p>Android powers hundreds of millions of phones, tablets, and other devices in a wide variety of screen sizes and
form factors. By taking advantage of Android's flexible layout system, you can create apps that
gracefully scale from large tablets to smaller phones.</p>

<h4>Be flexible</h4>

<p>Stretch and compress your layouts to accommodate various heights and widths.</p>

<h4>Optimize layouts</h4>

<p>On larger devices, take advantage of extra screen real estate. Create compound views that combine
multiple views to reveal more content and ease navigation.</p>

<h4>Assets for all</h4>
<p>Provide resources for different screen densities (<acronym title="Dots per inch">DPI</acronym>) to
ensure that your app looks great on any device.</p>

<p>So where do you begin when designing for multiple screens? One approach is to work in the base
standard (normal size and <acronym title="Medium density (160 dpi)">MDPI</acronym>) and scale it up or
down for the other buckets. Another approach is to start with the device with the largest screen
size, and then scale down and figure out the UI compromises you'll need to make on smaller screens.</p>
