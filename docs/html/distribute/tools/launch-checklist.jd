<p>
  Before you publish your apps on Google Play and distribute them to users, you
  need to get the apps ready, test them, and prepare your promotional
  materials.
</p>

<p>
  This page helps you understand the publishing process and get ready for a
  successful product launch on Google Play. It summarizes some of the tasks
  you'll need to complete before publishing your app on Google Play, such as
  creating a signed, release-ready application package (APK), understanding the
  requirements of the app, and creating the product page and graphic assets for
  each of your apps.
</p>

<p>
  The preparation and publishing tasks are numbered to give you a rough idea of
  sequence. However, you can handle the tasks in any sequence that works for
  you or you can skip steps as appropriate.
</p>

<p>
  As you move toward publishing, a variety of support resources are available
  to you. Relevant links are provided in each step.
</p>

<div class="headerLine">
  <h2 id="understand-publishing">
    1. Understand the Publishing Process
  </h2>


</div>

<p>
  Before you begin the steps in this checklist, you should take a moment to
  read and understand the overall publishing workflow and become familiar with
  how the process works. In particular, you or your development team will need
  to prepare your apps for release using a process common to all Android apps.
  The <a href="{@docRoot}tools/publishing/publishing_overview.html">Publishing
  workflow documents</a> provide the details on how publishing works and how to
  get an APK ready for release.
</p>

<p>
  Once you are familiar with publishing in general, continue reading to
  understand the issues that you should consider when publishing apps on Google
  Play.

  </h2>


</div>

<p>
  Before you publish apps on Google Play, it's important to make sure that they
  meet the basic quality expectations for all Android apps, on all of the
  devices that you are targeting. You can check your app's quality by setting
  up a test environment and testing the app against a short set of
  <strong>quality criteria that applies to all apps</strong>. For complete
  information, see the <a href=
  "{@docRoot}distribute/essentials/quality/core.html">Core App Quality</a>
  guidelines.
</p>

<p>
  If your app is targeting tablet devices, make sure that it delivers a rich,
  compelling experience to your tablet customers. See the <a href=
  "{@docRoot}distribute/essentials/quality/tablets.html">Tablet App Quality</a>
  guidelines for recommendations on ways to optimize your app for tablets.
</p>

<p>
  If you plan to make your apps available to Google Play for Education, then
  you need to make sure they are suitable for a K-12 classroom and offer
  outstanding educational value. See the <a href=
  "{@docRoot}distribute/essentials/gpfe-guidelines.html">Education
  Guidelines</a> for information on the characteristics your education apps
  should exhibit.

<div class="headerLine">
  <h2 id="determine-rating">
    4. Determine your App’s Content Rating
  </h2>


</div>

<p>
  Google Play requires you to set a content rating for your app, which informs
  Google Play users of its maturity level. Before you publish, you should
  confirm what rating level you want to use. The available content rating
  levels are:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Everyone
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      Low maturity
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      Medium maturity
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      High maturity
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  On their Android devices, Android users can set the desired maturity level
  for browsing. Google Play then filters apps based on the setting, so the
  content rating you select can affect the app's distribution to users. You can
  assign (or change) the content rating for your apps in the Developer Console,
  no changes are required in your app binary.
</p>

<div class="headerLine">
  <h2 id="determine-country">
    5. Determine Country Distribution
  </h2>


</div>

<p>
  Google Play lets you control what countries and territories your apps are
  distributed to. For the widest reach and the largest potential customer base,
  you’d normally want to distribute to all available countries and territories.
  However, because of business needs, app requirements, or launch dependencies,
  you might want to exclude one or more countries from your distribution.
</p>

<p>
  It's important to determine the exact country distribution early, because it
  can affect:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      The need for localized resources in the app.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      The need for a localized app description in the Developer Console.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      Legal requirements for the app that may be specific to certain countries.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      Time zone support, local pricing, and so on.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  With your target countries in mind, you should assess your localization
  needs, both in your apps and in their Google Play listings details, and start
  the work of localization well in advance of your target launch date.
</p>

<p>
  See <a href=
  "{@docRoot}distribute/tools/localization-checklist.html">Localization

<div class="headerLine">
  <h2 id="confirm-size">
    6. Confirm the App's Overall Size
  </h2>


</div>

<p>
  The overall size of your app can affect its design and how you publish it on
  Google Play. Currently, the maximum size for an APK published on Google Play
  is <strong>100 MB</strong>. If your app exceeds that size, or if you want to
  offer a secondary download, you can use <a href=
  "{@docRoot}google/play/expansion-files.html">APK Expansion Files</a>, which
  Google Play will host for free on its server infrastructure and automatically
  handle the download to devices.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      The maximum size for an APK published on Google Play is 100 MB.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      You can use up to two (2) APK Expansion Files, each up to 2GB in size,
      for each APK.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Using APK Expansion files is a convenient, cost-effective method of
  distributing large apps. However, the use of APK Expansion Files requires
  some changes in your app binary, so you will need to make those changes
  before creating your release-ready APK.
</p>

<p>
  To minimize the size of your app binary, make sure that you run the <a href=
  "{@docRoot}tools/help/proguard.html">Proguard</a> tool or similar obfuscator
  on your code when building your release-ready APK.
</p>

  <h2 id="confirm-platform">
    7. Confirm the App's Platform and Screen Compatibility Ranges
  </h2>


</div>

<p>
  Before publishing, it's important to make sure that your apps are designed to
  run properly on the Android platform versions and device screen sizes that
  you want to target.
</p>

<p>
  From an app-compatibility perspective, Android platform versions are defined
  by <a href=
  "{@docRoot}guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element.html#ApiLevels">API
  level</a>. You should confirm the minimum version that your app is compatible
  with <a href=
  "{@docRoot}guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element.html">&lt;minSdkVersion&gt;</a>,
  as that will affect its distribution to Android devices once it is published.
</p>

<p>
  For screen sizes, you should confirm that the app runs properly and looks
  good on the range of screen sizes and pixel densities that you want to
  support. You should follow the advice provided in <a href=
  "{@docRoot}guide/practices/screens_support.html">Supporting Multiple
  Screens</a> to provide scalable support for multiple screen sizes. However,
  if you have been unable to do so, declare the minimum screen-size supported
  by your apps using <a href=
  "{@docRoot}guide/topics/manifest/supports-screens-element.html">&lt;supports-screens&gt;</a>.
  Google Play will then restrict the availability of your apps accordingly,
  making them available to devices with the declared screen size or large.
</p>

<p>
  To get a better understanding of the current device penetration of Android
  platform versions and screen sizes across all Android devices, see the
  <a href="{@docRoot}about/dashboards/index.html">Device Dashboard</a> charts.

<div class="figure">

</div>

<p>
  On Google Play, you can publish apps as free to download or priced. Free apps
  can be downloaded by any Android user in Google Play. Paid apps can be
  downloaded only by users who are in a country that supports paid downloads
  and have registered a form of payment in Google Play, such as a credit card
  or Direct Carrier Billing.
</p>

<p>
  Deciding whether you apps will be free or paid is important because, on
  Google Play, <strong>free apps must remain free</strong>.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Once you publish an app as a free app, you cannot change it to being a
      priced app. However, you can still sell <a href=
      "{@docRoot}google/play/billing/billing_overview.html#products">in-app
      products</a> and <a href=
      "{@docRoot}google/play/billing/billing_subscriptions.html">subscriptions</a>
      through Google Play's <a href=
      "{@docRoot}google/play/billing/index.html">In-app Billing</a> service.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      If you publish your app as a priced app, you <em>can</em> change it at
      any time to be a free app (<strong>but cannot then change it back to
      priced</strong>). You can also sell in-app products and subscriptions.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  If your app is be priced, or if you'll be selling in-app products, you need
  to <a href=
  "{@docRoot}distribute/googleplay/start.html">
  set up a Google payments merchant account</a> before you can publish.

    9. Consider using In-app Billing or Android Pay
  </h2>


</div>

<p>
  Google Play <a href="{@docRoot}google/play/billing/index.html">In-app
  Billing</a> lets you sell digital content in your applications. You can use
  the service to sell a wide range of content, including downloadable content
  such as media files or photos, and virtual content such as game levels or
  potions. In-app Billing service lets you sell one-time purchases and
  subscriptions from inside your app. This can help you to monetize the app
  over its installed lifetime.
</p>
<p>
  Android Pay enables simple and secure purchases of physical goods and services
  in your app, such as clothing, food delivery or movie tickets
</p>
<p>
  If your are looking for more ways to monetize your app and build engagement,
  you should consider In-app Billing or Android Pay. These services have become
  very popular with both users and developers. To use In-app Billing or Android
  Pay, you need to make changes to your app binary, so you will need to
  complete and test your implementation before creating your release-ready APK.

  users in markets around the world. You can set prices individually in
  different currencies, so you have the flexibility to adjust your price
  according to market conditions and exchange rates.
</p>

<p>
  Before you publish, consider how you’ll price your products and what your

    11. Start Localization
  </h2>


</div>

<p>
  With your country targeting in mind, it's a good idea to assess your
  localization needs, ensure your apps are internationalized, and start the
  work of localizing well in advance of your target launch date.
</p>

<p>
  In addition to your application design, there are at least three aspects of
  localization to consider:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Localizing the strings, images, and other resources in your apps.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      Localizing your apps’ store listing details on Google Play.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      Localizing the apps’ graphic assets, screenshots, and videos that
      accompany your store listing.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  See <a href=
  "{@docRoot}distribute/tools/localization-checklist.html">Localization
  Checklist</a> for key steps and considerations in the localization process.
</p>

<p>
  To localize your store listing, first create and finalize your app title,
  description, and promotional text. Collect and send all of these for
  localization. You can optionally translate the "Recent Changes" text for app
  updates as well. Later you can add your localized listing details in the
  Developer Console, or you can choose to let Google Play auto-translate your
  listing details into the languages you support.
</p>

<p>
  A key part of making your app listing attractive to a global customer base is
  creating localized versions of your promotional graphics, screenshots and
  videos. For example, your app's feature graphic might include text that
  should be translated, for maximum effectiveness. You can create different
  versions of your promotional graphics for each language and upload them to
  the Developer Console. If you offer a promotional video, you can create
  localized versions of it and then add a link to the correct localized video
  for each language you support.
</p>

<p>
  When your translations are complete, move them into your app resources as
  needed and test that they are loaded properly. Save your app's translated
  listing details for later, when you upload assets and configure the store
  listing.
</p>

  <h2 id="prepare-graphics">
    12. Prepare Promotional Graphics, Screenshots, and Videos
  </h2>


</div>

<p>
  When you publish on Google Play, you can supply a variety of high-quality
  graphic assets to showcase your app or brand. After you publish, these appear
  on your store listing page, search results, and elsewhere. These graphic
  assets are key parts of a successful store listing page that attracts and
  engages users, so you should consider having a professional produce them for
  you. Screenshots and videos are also very important, because they show how
  your apps look, how they’re used or played, and what makes them different.
</p>

<p>
  All of your graphic assets should be designed so that they are easy to see
  and highlight your apps or brand in a colorful, interesting way. The assets
  should reference the same logo and icon as users will find in the All Apps
  launcher once they have downloaded the app. Your graphic assets should also
  fit in well with the graphic assets of all the apps you publish, which will
  be also be displayed to users on your store listing page.
</p>

<p>
  To help you market your apps more effectively to a global audience, Google
  Play lets you create localized versions of your promotional graphics,
  screenshots, and videos and upload them to the Developer Console. When a user
  visits your app's store listing, Google Play displays the promotional
  graphic, screenshots, and video that you've provided for the user's language.
</p>

<p>
  To localize your promotional graphics, you can translate any embedded text,
  use different imagery or presentation, or change your marketing approach to
  best address the needs of users in specific languages. For example, if your
  feature or promotional graphic includes an embedded product name or tag line,
  you can translate that text and add it to a localized version of the
  promotional graphic.
</p>

<p>
  Because your localized graphic assets and videos are so important, you should
  get started on creating and localizing them well in advance of your target
  publishing date.

  You upload the release-ready APKs to your Developer Console and distribute to
  users.
</p>

<p>
  The process for preparing a release-ready APK is the same for all apps,
  regardless of how they are distributed. Generally the process includes basic
  code cleanup and optimization, building and signing with your release key,
  and final testing.

      to the Developer Console.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>
  Before launching your apps, it's always valuable to get real-world feedback
  from users &mdash; even more so when you are launching new apps. It's highly
  recommended that you distribute a pre-release version of your app to users
  across your key markets and provide an easy means for them to provide
  feedback and report bugs.
</p>

<p>
  Google Play can help you set up a beta program for your app. After you sign
  in to your Developer Console and have upload your APKs, you can set up groups
  of users for alpha and beta testing the apps. You can start with a small
  group of alpha testers, then move to a larger group of beta testers. Once
  users are added, they access your app's store listing and install the app.
  <strong>Users on alpha or beta versions cannot leave reviews or
  ratings</strong>, so there is <strong>no risk to your rating</strong> on
  Google Play. You need to arrange a mechanism for any testing feedback to be
  delivered - such as a Google Forum or Google+.
</p>

<p>
  The feedback you receive will help you adjust your UI, translations, and
  store listing to ensure a great experience for users.

<p>
  On Google Play, your apps’ product information is shown to users on their

  and the pages from which they will decide to purchase or download your apps,
  on their Android devices or on the web.
</p>

<p>
  Google Play gives you a variety of ways to promote your apps and engage with
  users on your store listing pages, from colorful graphics, screenshots, and

  apps. As you prepare to publish your apps, make sure that you take advantage
  of all that your product detail pages can offer, making your apps as
  compelling as possible to users.
</p>

<p>
  You should begin planning your product pages in advance of your target launch
  date, arranging for localized description, high-quality graphic assets,
  screenshots and video, and so on.
</p>

<p>
  As you get near your target publishing date, you should become familiar with
  all the fields, options, and assets associated with the store listing
  configuration page in the Developer Console. As you collect the information
  and assets for the page, make sure that you can enter or upload it to the
  Developer Console, until the page is complete and ready for publishing.
</p>

<p>
  After you've set your apps’ geographic targeting in the Developer Console,
  remember to add your localized store listing, promotional graphics, and so
  on, for all of the languages that you support.
</p>

<p>
  If your app is targeting tablet devices, make sure to include at least one
  screenshot of the app running on a tablet, and highlight your apps’ support
  for tablets in the app description, release notes, promotional campaigns, and
  elsewhere.

    16. Use Google Play Badges and Links in your Promotional Campaigns
  </h2>


</div>

<p>
  Google Play badges give you an officially branded way of promoting your apps
  to Android users. Use the <a href=
  "{@docRoot}distribute/tools/promote/badges.html">Google Play Badge
  generator</a> to quickly create badges to link users to your products from
  web pages, ads, reviews, and more. You can also use special <a href=
  "{@docRoot}distribute/tools/promote/linking.html">link formats</a> to link
  directly to your store listing page, to a list of your products, or to search
  results.
</p>

<p>
  To help your apps get traction after launch, it's strongly recommended that
  you support launch with a promotional campaign that announces your product
  through many channels as possible, in as many countries as possible. For
  example, you can promote a launch using ad placements, social network or blog
  posts, video and other media, interviews and reviews, or any other channels
  available.

    18. Support Users after Launch
  </h2>


</div>

<p>
  After you publish apps or app updates, it's crucial for you to support your
  customers. Prompt and courteous support can provide a better experience for
  users that results in better ratings and more positive reviews for your
  products. Users are likely to be more engaged with your app and recommend it
  if you’re responsive to their needs and feedback. This is especially true
  after publishing if you’re using a coordinated promotional campaign.
</p>

<p>
  There are a number of ways that you can keep in touch with users and offer
  them support. The most fundamental is to provide your <em>support email
  address</em> on your store listing pages. Beyond that, you can provide
  support in any way you choose, such as a forum, mailing list, or a Google+
  page. The Google Play team provides user support for downloading, installing.
  and payments issues, but issues that fall outside of these topics will be in
  your domain. Examples of issues you can support include: feature requests,
  questions about using the apps, and questions about compatibility settings.
</p>

<p>
  After publishing, plan to:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Check your ratings and reviews frequently on your apps’ store listing
      pages. Watch for recurring themes that could signal bugs or other issues.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      Be mindful of new Android platform version launches, as compatibility
      settings for your apps might need to be updated.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      Put a link to your support resources on your website and set up any other
      support such as forums.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      Provide an appropriate support email address on your store listing pages
      and respond to users when they take the time to email you.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      Beyond the automatic refund window offered by Google Play, be generous
      with your own refund policy, as satisfied users will be more likely to
      purchase in the future.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      Acknowledge and fix issues in your apps. It helps to be transparent and
      list known issues on your store listing pages proactively.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      Publish updates as frequently as you’re able, without sacrificing quality
      or annoying users with too-frequent updates.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      With each update, make sure to provide a summary of what's changed. You
      can enter this information in the Developer Console. Users will read it
      and appreciate that you are serious about improving the quality of your
      apps.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
</ul>
