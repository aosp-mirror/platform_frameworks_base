  In-App Subscriptions
  </p>
</div>

<p>
  Subscriptions provide an excellent opportunity to create continuing revenue
  streams. Subscriptions are similar to digital goods offered through <a href=
  "{@docRoot}google/play/billing/index.html">In-app Billing</a> but made
  available on a recurring monthly or annual basis.
</p>

<p>
  When users purchase subscriptions in your apps, Google Play handles all
  checkout details so your apps never have to directly process any financial
  transactions. Google Play processes all payments for subscriptions through
  Google Wallet, just as it does for standard in-app products and app
  purchases. This ensures a consistent and familiar purchase flow for your
  users and reduces cart abandonment rates.
</p>

<p>
  At a basic level you can offer use of your apps or access to their content on
  a subscription basis, using a <a href=
  "{@docRoot}google/play/billing/billing_subscriptions.html#trials">free trial
  subscription</a> to allow users to explore the apps or content.
</p>

<p>
  A more advanced approach is to offer specific features or content items as
  subscriptions within your apps. This way you can offer users basic or core
  features or content for free or part of the initial purchase and extended
  features or content as subscriptions. You can have multiple subscriptions
  active in an app at any one time.
</p>

<p>
  To get started with subscriptions you need to set-up a Google Wallet <a href=
  "{@docRoot}distribute/googleplay/start.html#merchant-account">Merchant
  Account</a> from the Developer Console. You then define subscriptions for
  published or draft apps in the <a href=
  "{@docRoot}distribute/googleplay/developer-console.html#in-app-billing">In-app
  Products</a> section of the Developer Console, integrate the In-app Billing
  API into your apps, and add the mechanisms to unlock subscribed features or
  deliver content.
</p>

  <p>
  <strong>Tip:</strong> Due to some direct carrier billing limits, we
  recommend monthly subscriptions. Annual subscriptions may exceed limits,
  causing the purchase to be blocked and you to lose that revenue.
