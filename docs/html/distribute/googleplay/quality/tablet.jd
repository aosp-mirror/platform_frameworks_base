<p>Before you publish an app on Google Play, it's important to make sure that
the app meets the basic expectations of tablet users through compelling features
and an intuitive, well-designed UI. </p>

<p>Tablets are a growing part of the Android installed base that offers new
opportunities for <a
href="{@docRoot}distribute/googleplay/spotlight/tablets.html">user engagement
and monetization</a>. If your app is targeting tablet users, this document helps
you focus on key aspects of quality, feature set, and UI that can have a
significant impact on the app's success. Each focus area is given as checklist
item, with each one comprising several smaller tasks or best practices.</p>

<p>Although the checklist tasks below are numbered for convenience, 
you can handle them in any order and address them to the extent that you feel
is right for your app. In the interest of delivering the best possible product
to your customers, follow the checklist recommendations
to the greatest extent possible. </p>

<p>As you move through the checklist, you'll find links to support resources
that can help you address the topics raised in each task.</p>


<h2 id="core-app-quality">1. Test for Core App Quality</h2>

<p>The first step in delivering a great tablet app experience is making sure
that it meets the <em>core app
quality criteria</em> for all of the devices and form factors that the app is
targeting. For complete information, see the <a
href="{@docRoot}distribute/googleplay/quality/core.html">Core App Quality Checklist</a>. 
</p>

<p>To assess the quality of your app on tablets &mdash; both for core app quality
and tablet app quality &mdash; you need to set up a suitable
hardware or emulator environment for testing. For more information, 
see <a href="#test-environment">Setting Up a Test Environment</a>.</p>

<h2 id="optimize-layouts">2. Optimize your layouts for larger screens</h2>

<p>Android makes it easy to develop an app that runs well on a wide range of
device screen sizes and form factors. This broad compatibility works in your
favor, since it helps you design a single app that you can distribute widely to
all of your targeted devices. However, to give your users the best possible
experience on each screen configuration &mdash; in particular on tablets
&mdash; you need to optimize your layouts and other UI components for each
targeted screen configuration. On tablets, optimizing your UI lets you take
full advantage of the additional screen available, such as to offer new features,
present new content, or enhance the experience in other ways to deepen user
engagement.</p>

<p>If you developed your app for handsets and now want to distribute it to
tablets, you can start by making minor adjustments to your layouts, fonts, and
spacing. In some cases &mdash; such as for 7-inch tablets or for a game with
large canvas &mdash; these adjustments may be all
you need to make your app look great. In other cases, such as for larger
tablets, you can redesign parts of your UI to replace "stretched UI" with an
efficient multipane UI, easier navigation, and additional content. </p>

<p>Here are some suggestions:</p>

<div style="width:390px;float:right;margin:1.5em;margin-top:0em;">
<img src="{@docRoot}images/training/app-navigation-multiple-sizes-multipane-bad.png" style="width:390px;padding:4px;margin-bottom:0em;">
<p class="image-caption" style="padding:0em .5em .5em 2em"><span
style="font-weight:500;">Get rid of "stretched" UI</span>: On tablets, single-pane layouts lead to awkward whitespace and excessive line lengths. Use padding to reduce the width of UI elements and consider using multi-pane layouts.</p>
</div>

<ul>
<li>Provide custom layouts as needed for <code>large</code> and
<code>xlarge</code> screens. You can also provide layouts that are loaded based
on the screen's <a href="{@docRoot}guide/practices/screens_support.html#NewQualifiers">shortest
dimension</a> or the <a href="{@docRoot}guide/practices/screens_support.html#NewQualifiers">minimum
available width and height</a>. </li>
<li>At a minimum, customize dimensions such as font sizes, margins, spacing for
larger screens, to improve use of space and content legibility. </li>
<li>Adjust positioning of UI controls so that they are easily accessible to
users when holding a tablet, such as toward the sides when in
landscape orientation.</li>
<li>Padding of UI elements should normally be larger on tablets than on handsets. A
<a href="{@docRoot}design/style/metrics-grids.html#48dp-rhythm">48dp rhythm</a> (and a 16dp
grid) is recommended.</li>
<li>Adequately pad text content so that it is not aligned directly along screen edges.
Use a minimum <code>16dp</code> padding around content near screen edges.</li>
</ul>

<p>In particular, make sure that your layouts do not appear "stretched"
across the screen:</p>

<ul>
<li>Lines of text should not be excessively long &mdash; optimize for a maximum
100 characters per line, with best results between 50 and 75.</li>
<li>ListViews and menus should not use the full screen width.</li>
<li>Use padding to manage the widths of onscreen elements or switch to a
multi-pane UI for tablets (see next section).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="use-extra-space">3. Take advantage of extra screen area available on tablets</h2>

<div style="width:290px;float:right;margin:1.5em;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:0;">
<img src="{@docRoot}images/training/app-navigation-multiple-sizes-multipane-good.png" style="width:280px;padding:4px;margin-bottom:0em;">
<p class="image-caption" style="padding:0em .5em .5em 1.5em"><span
style="font-weight:500;">Multi-pane layouts</span> result in a better visual balance on tablet screens, while offering more utility and legibility.</p>
</div>

<p>Tablet screens provide significantly more screen real estate to your app,
especially when in landscape orientation. In particular, 10-inch tablets offer a
greatly expanded  area, but even 7-inch tablets give you more space for
displaying content and engaging users. </p>

<p>As you consider the UI of your app when running on tablets, make sure that it
is taking full advantage of extra screen area available on tablets. Here are
some suggestions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Look for opportunities to include additional content or use an alternative
treatment of existing content.</li>
<li>Use <a href="{@docRoot}design/patterns/multi-pane-layouts.html">multi-pane
layouts</a> on tablet screens to combine single views into a compound view. This
lets you use the additional screen area more efficiently and makes it easier for
users to navigate your app. </li>
<li>Plan how you want the panels of your compound views to reorganize when
screen orientation changes.</li>



<div style="width:490px;margin:1.5em auto 1.5em 0;">

<div style="">
<img src="{@docRoot}images/ui-ex-single-panes.png" style="width:490px;padding:4px;margin-bottom:0em;" align="middle">

<p class="image-caption" style="padding:.5em"><span
style="font-weight:500;">Compound views</span> combine several single views from a handset UI <em>(above)</em> into a richer, more efficient UI for tablets <em>(below)</em>. </p>
</div>
</div>

<li>While a single screen is implemented as an {@link android.app.Activity}
subclass, consider implementing individual content panels as {@link
android.app.Fragment} subclasses. This lets you maximize code reuse across
different form factors and across screens that share content.</li>
<li>Decide on which screen sizes you'll use a multi-pane UI, then provide the
different layouts in the appropriate screen size buckets (such as
<code>large</code>/<code>xlarge</code>) or minimum screen widths (such as
<code>sw600dp</code>/<code>sw720</code>).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="use-tablet-icons">4. Use Icons and other assets that are designed for tablet screens</h2>

<p>So that your app looks its best, make sure to use icons and other bitmap
assets that are created specifically for the densities used by tablet screens.
Specifically, you should create sets of alternative bitmap drawables for each
density in the range commonly supported by tablets.</p>

<p class="table-caption"><strong>Table 1</strong>. Raw asset sizes for icon types.<table>

<p>Other points to consider: </p>

<ul>
<li>Icons in the action bar, notifications, and launcher should be designed
according to the icon design guidelines and have the same physical size on
tablets as on phones.</li>
<li>Use density-specific <a

resource qualifiers</a> to ensure that the proper set of alternative resources
gets loaded.</li>

<h2 id="adjust-font-sizes">5. Adjust font sizes and touch targets for tablet screens</h2>

<p>To make sure your app is easy to use on tablets, take some time to adjust the
font sizes and touch targets in your tablet UI, for all of the screen
configurations you are targeting. You can adjust font sizes through <a
href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/ui/themes.html">styleable attributes</a> or <a
href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/resources/more-resources.html#Dimension">dimension
resources</a>, and you can adjust touch targets through layouts and bitmap
drawables, as discussed above. </p>

<p>Here are some considerations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Text should not be excessively large or small on tablet screen sizes and
densities. Make sure that labels are sized appropriately for the UI elements they
correspond to, and ensure that there are no improper line breaks in labels,
titles, and other elements.</li>
<li>The recommended touch-target size for onscreen elements is 48dp (32dp
minimum) &mdash; some adjustments may be needed in your tablet UI. Read <a
href="http://developer.android.com/design/style/metrics-grids.html">Metrics and
Grids
</a> to learn about implementation strategies to help most of your users. To
meet the accessibility needs of certain users, it may be appropriate to use
larger touch targets. </li>
<li>When possible, for smaller icons, expand the touchable area to more than
48dp using {@link android.view.TouchDelegate} or just centering the icon within
the transparent button.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="adjust-widgets">6. Adjust sizes of home screen widgets for tablet screens</h2>

<p>If your app includes a home screen widget, here are a few points to consider
to ensure a great user experience on tablet screens: </p>

<ul>
<li>Make sure that the widget's default height and width are set appropriately
for tablet screens, as well as the minimum and maximum resize height and width.
</li>
<li>The widget should be resizable to 420dp or more, to span 5 or more home
screen rows (if this is a vertical or square widget) or columns (if this is a
horizontal or square widget). </li>
<li>Make sure that 9-patch images render correctly.</li>
<li>Use default system margins.</li>
<li>Set the app's <code>targetSdkVersion</code> to 14 or higher, if
possible.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="offer-full-feature-set">7. Offer the app's full feature set to tablet users</h2>

<p>Let your tablet users experience the best features of your app. Here are
some recommendations:</p>

<ul>
<li>Design your app to offer at least the same set of features on tablets as it does on
handsets. </li>
<li>In exceptional cases, your app might omit or replace certain features on
tablets if they are not supported by the hardware or use-case of most tablets.
For example:
<ul>
<li>If the handset uses telephony features but telephony is not available on the
current tablet, you can omit or replace the related functionality.</li>
<li>Many tablets have a GPS sensor, but most users would not normally carry
their tablets while running. If your phone app provides functionality to let the
user record a GPS track of their runs while carrying their phones, the app would not need to
provide that functionality on tablets because the use-case is not
compelling.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you will omit a feature or capability from your tablet UI, make sure
that it is not accessible to users or that it offers “graceful degradation”
to a replacement feature (also see the section below on hardware features).</li>
</ul>


<h2 id="hardware-requirements">8. Don’t require hardware features that might not be available on tablets</h2>

<p>Handsets and tablets typically offer slightly different hardware support for
sensors, camera, telephony, and other features. For example, many tablets are
available in a "Wi-Fi" configuration that does not include telephony support.</p>

<p>To ensure that you can deliver a single APK broadly across the
your full customer base, make sure that your app does not have built-in
requirements for hardware features that aren't commonly available on tablets.
</p>

<ul>
<li>Your app's manifest should not include <a
href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/manifest/uses-feature-element.html"><code>&lt;uses-feature&gt;</code></a>
elements for hardware features or capabilities that might not be
available on tablets, except when they are declared with the
<code>android:required=”false”</code> attribute. For example, your app should
not <em>require</em> features such as:
<ul>
<li><code>android.hardware.telephony</code></li>
<li><code>android.hardware.camera</code> (refers to back camera), or</li>
<li><code>android.hardware.camera.front</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Similarly, your app manifest should not include any <a
href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/manifest/permission-element.html"><code>&lt;permission&gt;</code></a> elements that <a
href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/manifest/uses-feature-element.html#permissions">imply
feature requirements</a> that might not be appropriate for tablets, except when
accompanied by a corresponding <code>&lt;uses-feature&gt;</code> element
declared with the <code>android:required=”false”</code> attribute.</li>
</ul>

<p>In all cases, the app must function normally when the hardware features it
uses are not available and should offer “graceful degradation” and alternative
functionality where appropriate. For example, if GPS is not supported on the device,
your app could let the user set their location manually. The app should do
run-time checking for the hardware capability that it needs and handle as needed.</p>

<h2 id="support-screens">9. Declare support for tablet screen configurations</h2>

<p>To ensure that you can distribute your app to a broad range of tablets,
declare all the screen sizes that your app supports in its manifest:</p>

<ul>
<li>Declare a <a
href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/manifest/supports-screens-element.html"><code>&lt;supports-screens&gt;</code></a> element
with appropriate attributes, as needed.</li>
<li>If the app declares a <code>&lt;compatible-screens&gt;</code> element in the
manifest, the element must include attributes that specify <em>all of the size and
density combinations for tablet screens</em> that the app supports. Note that, if possible,
you should avoid using this element in your app.</li>
</ul>

</tr>
</table>


<h2 id="google-play">10. Follow best practices for publishing in Google Play</h2>

<ul>
<li>Publish your app as a single APK for all screen sizes (handsets
and tablets), with a single Google Play listing:
  <ul style="margin-top:.25em;">
    <li>Easier for users to find your app from search, browsing, or promotions</li>
    <li>Easier for users to restore your app automatically if they get a new device.</li>
    <li>Your ratings and download stats are consolidated across all devices.</li>
    <li>Publishing a tablet app in a second listing can dilute ratings for your brand.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>If necessary, you can alternatively choose to deliver your app using <a 
href="{@docRoot}guide/google/play/publishing/multiple-apks.html">Multiple APK Support</a>, 
although in most cases using a single APK to reach all devices is strongly recommended.</li>

<li>Highlight your app’s tablet capabilities in the product details page:
  <ul style="margin-top:.25em;">
    <li>Add <strong>at least one screenshot taken while the app is running on a
    tablet</strong>. It's recommended that you add one screenshot of landscape orientation
    and one of portrait orientation, if possible. These screenshots make it clear to users
    that your app is designed for tablets and highlight all the effort you've put into designing
    a great tablet app experience.</li>
    <li>Mention tablet support in the app description.</li>
    <li>Include information about tablet support in the app's release notes and update
    information.</li>
    <li>In your app's promo video, add shots of your app running on a tablet.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>Make sure you are distributing to tablet devices. Check the app's Supported Devices
list in the <a href="https://play.google.com/apps/publish/">Developer Console</a>
to make sure your app is not filtered from tablet devices that you want to target.</li>

<li>Let tablet users know about your app! Plan a marketing or advertising campaign that
highlights the use of your app on tablets.</li>

<h2 id="test-environment">Setting Up a Test Environment for Tablets</h2>

<p>To assess the quality of your app on tablets &mdash; both for core app quality
and tablet app quality &mdash; you need to set up a suitable
hardware or emulator environment for testing. </p>

<p>The ideal test environment would
include a small number of actual hardware devices that represent key form
factors and hardware/software combinations currently available to consumers.
It's not necessary to test on <em>every</em> device that's on the market &mdash;
rather, you should focus on a small number of representative devices, even using
one or two devices per form factor.  The table below provides an overview of
devices you could use for testing.</p>

<p>If you are not able to obtain actual hardware devices for testing, you should
<a href="{@docRoot}tools/devices/index.html">set up emulated devices (AVDs)</a>
to represent the most common form factors and
hardware/software combinations. See the table below for suggestions on the emulator
configurations to use. </p>

<p>To go beyond basic testing, you can add more devices, more form factors, or
new hardware/software combinations to your test environment. For example, you
could include mid-size tablets, tablets with more or fewer hardware/software
features, and so on. You can also increase the number or complexity of tests
and quality criteria. </p>

<p class="table-caption"><strong>Table 1</strong>. A typical tablet test environment might
include one or two devices from each row in the table below, with one of the
