</div>

<p>
  If you want to sell apps or in-app products, link your Google Wallet Merchant

    Store Listing Details

</div>

<p>
  Use the Developer Console to set up a <em>Store Listing page</em>. This is
  the home for your app in Google Play. It's the page users see on their mobile
  phones or on the web to learn about your app and download it.
</p>

<p>
  Upload custom brand assets, screenshots, and videos to highlight what's great
  about your app. Provide a localized description, add notes about the latest
  version, and more. You can update your store listing at any time.

<div class="headerLine">
  <h2 id="upload-instantly-publish">
    Upload and Instantly Publish
  </h2>


</div>

<p>
  From the Developer Console you can quickly upload and publish a release-ready
  Android application package file. The app is a <em>draft</em> until you
  publish it, at which time Google Play makes your store listing page and app
  available to users&mdash;your app appears in the store listings within hours,
  not weeks.
</p>

<p>
  Once your app is published, you can update it as often as you want: Change
  prices, configuration, and distribution options at any time, without needing
  to update your app binary.
</p>

<p>
  As you add features or address code issues, you can publish an updated binary
  at any time. The new version is available almost immediately and existing
  customers are notified that an update is ready for download. Users can also
  accept automatic updates to your app, so that your updates are delivered and
  installed as soon as you publish them. You can unpublish your apps app at any
  time.
</p>

<div class="headerLine">
  <h2 id="alpha-beta">
    Alpha and Beta Testing
  </h2>


</div>

<p>
  It's always valuable to get real-world feedback from users, especially before
  launch. Google Play makes it easy to distribute pre-release versions of your
  app to alpha and beta test groups anywhere in the world.
</p>

<p>
  In the <strong>APK</strong> section of your Google Play Developer Console
  you’ll find the <strong>Alpha Testing</strong> and <strong>Beta
  Testing</strong> tabs. Here you can upload versions of your apps’ APK files
  and define a list of testers as a <a href=
  "https://support.google.com/groups/answer/46601">Google Group</a> or <a href=
  "https://support.google.com/plus/topic/2888488">Google+ Community</a>. Once
  this is done you’ll receive a URL that you forward to your testers, from
  which they can opt-in to the testing program.
</p>

<div>
  <img src="{@docRoot}images/gp-dc-ab.png" class="frame">
</div>

<p>
  After opting-in, your testers then go to your app’s product page and when
  they download the app Google Play will deliver them the alpha or beta version
  as appropriate. Incidentally, if a user happens to be opted-in to both your
  testing groups, Google Play will always deliver them the alpha test version.
</p>

<p>
  Note that users cannot provide feedback and reviews on alpha and beta
  versions of your apps. To gather feedback you could used the <a href=
  "https://support.google.com/groups/answer/46601">Google Group</a> or <a href=
  "https://support.google.com/plus/topic/2888488">Google+ Community</a>, or
  setup an email address or your own website.
</p>

<p>
  You can use these testing programs to <a href=
  "{@docRoot}distribute/essentials/optimizing-your-app.html">optimize your
  apps</a>, help with <a href=
  "{@docRoot}distribute/users/expand-to-new-markets.html">rollout to new

</p>

<div class="headerLine">
  <h2 id="staged-rollouts">
    Staged Rollouts
  </h2>


</div>

<p>
  You can also stage the rollout of your apps using the Production tab in the
  APK section of your Google Play Developer Console. Here you can define the
  percentage of user who’ll be able to download your app.
</p>

<p>
  Staging your rollout will help limit the impact of unexpected bugs or server
  load and enable you to gauge user feedback with an unbiased sample of users.
  Users can rate and review your apps during staged roll outs, so if you’re
  hesitant, start your rollout to a small percentage of users. Be sure to watch
  for and respond to any negative reviews.
</p>

<p>
  Note that rollbacks aren’t supported due to the <a href=
  "{@docRoot}tools/publishing/versioning.html">app versioning requirements</a>
  of the Android platform. If you need to rollback, consider launching a
  previous APK with a new version number. However, this practice should be used
  only as a last resort, as users will lose access to new features and your old
  app may not be forward-compatible with your server changes or data formats,
  so be sure to run <a href="#alpha-beta">alpha and beta tests</a> of your
  updates.
</p>

<div class="headerLine">
  <h2 id="multiple-apk">
    Multiple APK Support
  </h2>


</div>

<p>
  In most cases, a single app package (APK) is all you need, and it’s usually
  the easiest way to manage and maintain the app. However, if you need to
  deliver a different APK to different devices, Google Play provides a way to
  do that.
</p>

<p>
  <em>Multiple APK support</em> lets you create multiple app packages that use
  the same package name but differ in their OpenGL texture compression formats,
  screen-size support, or Android platform versions supported. You can simply
  upload all the APKs under a single product listing and Google Play selects
  the best ones to deliver to users, based on the characteristics of their
  devices.
</p>

<p>
  You can also upload up to two secondary downloads for each published APK,
  including multiple APKs, using the <em>APK Expansion Files</em> option. Each
  expansion file can be up to 2GB and contain any type of code or assets.
  Google Play hosts them for free and handles the download of the files as part
  of the normal app installation.

<p>
  You have tools to set prices for your apps and in-app products. Your app can
  be free to download or priced, requiring payment before download.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you publish your app as free, it must <strong>remain free for the life
  of the app</strong>. Free apps can be downloaded by all users in Google Play.
  </li>

  <li>If you publish it as priced, you can later change it to free. Priced apps
  can be purchased and downloaded only by users who have registered a form of
  payment in Google Play.

      Supported locations for distributing applications</a> for a list of
      countries where you can distribute or sell your apps.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>
  You can also offer in-app products and subscriptions, whether the app is free
  or priced. Set prices separately for priced apps, in-app products, and
  subscriptions.
</p>

<p>
  When users browse your app product pages or initiate a purchase, Google Play
  shows them the price they’ll be charged in their local currency.
</p>

<p>
  For each product, you initially set a default price in your own currency. If
  you do no more, Google Play will automatically set local prices once a month
  based on the US-Dollar price for your app.
</p>

<p>
  However, Google Play gives you complete control over how you price your
  products in each country. To start you can manually set fixed local prices
  from the default price, using the <strong>auto-convert prices now</strong>
  feature. You can then review these prices and set new ones for any countries
  you wish &mdash; the price for each country is independent, so you can adjust
  one price without affecting others. For most countries, the price you set is
  the final price charged to users, including taxes.
</p>

</div>

<p>
  You can sell in-app products and subscriptions using <a href=
  "{@docRoot}google/play/billing/index.html">Google Play In-app Billing</a> as
  a way to monetize your apps. In-app products are one-time purchases, while
  subscriptions are recurring charges on a monthly or annual basis.
</p>

<p>
  In the <strong>In-app Products</strong> section for a specific published or
  draft APK you:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Create product lists for in-app products and subscriptions.
  </li>

  <li>Set prices.
  </li>

  <li>Publish the products with the app or withdraw obsolete products.

<h3 id="geotargeting">

<p>
  You can use controls in the Google Play Developer Console to easily manage

  application binary. You can specify which countries and territories you want
  to distribute to, and even which carriers (for some countries).
</p>

<p>
  When users visit the store, Google Play makes sure that they are in one of
  your targeted countries before downloading your app. You can change your
  country and carrier targeting at any time just by saving changes in the
  Google Play Developer Console.

</p>

<h3 id="captargeting">

<p>
  Google Play also lets you control distribution according to device features
  or capabilities that your app depends on. There are several types of
  dependencies that the app can define in its manifest, such as hardware
  features, OpenGL texture compression formats, libraries, Android platform
  versions, and others.
</p>

<p>
  When you upload your app, Google Play reads the dependencies and sets up any
  necessary distribution rules. For technical information about declaring
  dependencies, read <a href="{@docRoot}google/play/filters.html">Filters on
  Google Play</a>.
</p>

<p>
  For pinpoint control over distribution, Google Play lets you see all of the
  devices your app is available to based on its dependencies (if any). From the
  Google Play Developer Console, you can list the supported devices and even
  exclude specific devices if needed.
