<p>Before you publish your app on Google Play and distribute it to users, you
need to get the app ready, test it, and prepare your promotional materials. </p>

<p>This document helps you understand the publishing process and get ready for a
successful product launch on Google Play. It summarizes some of the
tasks you'll need to complete before publishing your app on Google Play, such as
creating a signed, release-ready APK, understanding the requirements of the app,
and creating the product page and graphic assets for your app.</p>

<p>The preparation and publishing tasks are numbered to give you a rough idea of
sequence. However, you can handle the tasks in any sequence that works for you
or you can skip steps as appropriate.</p>

<p>As you move toward publishing, a variety of support resources are available to
you. Relevant links are provided in each step.</p>


<h2 id="process">1. Understand the publishing process</h2>

<p>Before you begin the steps in this checklist, you should take a moment to
read and understand the overall publishing workflow and become familiar with how
the process works. In particular, you or your development team will need to
prepare your app for release using a process common to all Android apps.
The <a
href="{@docRoot}tools/publishing/publishing_overview.html">Publishing
Workflow</a> documents provide the details on how publishing works and how to
get an APK ready for release. </p>

<p>Once you are familiar with publishing in general, read this document to
understand the issues that you should consider when publishing an app on Google
Play. </p>

</ul>
</td>

</table>

<h2 id="policies">2. Understand Google Play policies and agreements</h2>

<p>Make sure that you understand and follow the Google Play program policies
that you accepted when registering. Google Play actively enforces the policies
and any violations can lead to suspension of your app or, for repeated
violations, termination of your developer account. </p>

<h2 id="core-app-quality">3. Test for Core App Quality</h2>

<p>Before you publish an app on Google Play, it's important to make sure that
it meets the basic quality expectations for all Android apps, on all of the devices that you
are targeting. You can check your app's quality by setting up a test
environment and testing the app against a short set of <strong>core app quality criteria</strong>.
For complete information, see the <a
href="{@docRoot}distribute/googleplay/quality/core.html">Core App Quality Guidelines</a>. 
</p>

<p>If your app is targeting tablet devices, make sure that it delivers a rich, compelling
experience to your tablet customers. See the <a
href="{@docRoot}distribute/googleplay/quality/tablet.html">Tablet App Quality Checklist</a>
for recommendations on ways to optimize your app for tablets.</p>

possible experience to tablet users.</li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h2 id="rating">4. Determine your app's content rating</h2>

<p>Google Play requires you to set a content rating for your app, which informs
Google Play users of its maturity level. Before you publish, you should confirm
what rating level you want to use. The available content rating levels are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Everyone</li>
<li>Low maturity</li>
<li>Medium maturity</li>
<li>High maturity</li>
</ul>

<p>On their Android devices, Android users can set the desired maturity level
for browsing. Google Play then filters apps based on the setting, so the content
rating you select can affect the app's distribution to users. You can assign (or
change) the content rating for your app in the Developer Console, so no changes
are required in your app binary.</p>

</ul>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h2 id="countries">5. Determine country distribution</h2>

<p>Google Play lets you control what countries and territories your app is
distributed to. For widest reach and the largest potential customer base, you
would normally want to distribute to all available countries and territories.
However, because of business needs, app requirements, or launch dependencies,
you might want to exclude one or more countries from your distribution. </p>

<p>It's important to determine the exact country distribution early, because it
can affect:</p>
<ul>
<li>The need for localized resources in the app</li>
<li>The need for a localized app description in the Developer Console</li>
<li>Legal requirements for the app that may be specific to certain
countries</li>
<li>Time zone support, local pricing, and so on.</li>
</ul>

<p>With your country targeting in mind, you should assess what
your localization needs are, both in your app and in its Google Play listing
details, and start the work of localization well in advance of your
launch target date.</p>

.</li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h2 id="size">6. Confirm the app's overall size</h2>

<p>The overall size of your app can affect its design and how you publish it on
Google Play. Currently, the maximum size for an APK published on Google Play is
<strong>50 MB</strong>. If your app exceeds that size, or if you want to offer a
secondary download, you can use <a
href="{@docRoot}guide/google/play/expansion-files.html">APK Expansion Files</a>,
which Google Play will host for free on its server infrastructure and
automatically handle the download to devices.</p>

<ul>
<li>The maximum size for an APK published on Google Play is 50 MB.</li>
<li>You can use up to two (2) APK Expansion Files, each up to 2 GB in size, for
each APK.</li>
</ul>

<p>Using APK Expansion files is a convenient, cost-effective method of
distributing large apps. However, the use of APK Expansion Files requires some
changes in your app binary, so you will need to make those changes before
creating your release-ready APK.</p>

</ul>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h2 id="compatibility">7. Confirm the app's platform and screen compatibility ranges</h2>

<p>Before publishing, it's important to make sure that your app is designed to
run properly on the Android platform versions and device screen sizes that you
want to target. 

<p>From an app-compatibility perspective, Android platform versions are defined
by <a href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element.html#ApiLevels">API level</a>. You should
confirm the minimum version that your app is compatible with (<a
href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element.html"><code>&lt;minSdkVersion&gt;</code></a>),
as that will affect its distribution to Android
devices once it is published. </p>

<p>For screen sizes, you should confirm that the app runs properly and looks
good on the range of screen sizes and densities that you want to support. You
should confirm the minimum screen-size and density support that your app
declares (<a
href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/manifest/supports-screens-element.html"><code>&lt;supports-screens&gt;</code></a>),
since that can affect its distribution to
Android devices once it is published. </p>

<p>To get a better understanding of the current device penetration of Android
platform versions and screen sizes across all Android devices, see the <a
href="{@docRoot}about/dashboards/index.html">Device Dashboard</a>
charts.</p>

<h2 id="free-priced">8. Decide whether your app will be free or priced</h2>

<p>On Google Play, you can publish apps as free to download or priced. Free apps
can be downloaded by any Android user in Google Play.
Paid apps can be downloaded only by users who have registered a form of payment
in Google Play, such as a credit card or Direct Carrier Billing.</p>

<p>Deciding whether you app will be free or paid is important because, on Google
Play, <strong>free apps must remain free</strong>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Once you publish your app as a free app, you cannot ever change it to being
a priced app. However, you can still sell in-app products and
subscriptions through Google Play's In-app Billing service.</li>
<li>If you publish your app as a priced app, you <em>can</em> change
it at any time to being a free app (but cannot then change it back to
priced). You can also sell in-app products and subscriptions. </li>
</ul>

<p> If your app is be priced, or if you'll be selling in-app products,
you need set up a Checkout Merchant Account before you can publish.</p>

<h2 id="inapp-billing">9. Consider using In-app Billing</h2>

<p>Google Play <a href="{@docRoot}guide/google/play/billing/index.html">In-app
Billing</a> lets you sell digital content in your applications. You can use the
service to sell a wide range of content, including downloadable content such as
media files or photos, and virtual content such as game levels or potions.
In-app Billing service lets you sell one-time purchases and subscriptions from
inside your app. This can help you to monetize the app over its installed
lifetime. </p>

<p>If your are looking for more ways to monetize your app and build engagement,
you should consider In-app Billing. The service has become very popular with
both users and developers. To use In-app Billing, you need to make changes to
your app binary, so you will need to complete and test your implementation
before creating your release-ready APK.</p>

</table>

<h2 id="pricing">10. Set prices for your products</h2>

<p>If your app is priced or you will sell in-app products, Google Play lets you
set prices for your products in a variety of currencies, for users in markets
around the world. You can set prices individually in different currencies, so
you have the flexibility to adjust your price according to market conditions and
exchange rates. </p>

<p>Before you publish, consider how you will price your products
and what your prices will be in various currencies. Later, you can set prices
in all available currencies through the Developer Console.</p>

<h2 id="localize">11. Start localization</h2>

<p>With your country targeting in mind, it's a good idea to assess your localization
needs and start the work of localizing well in advance of your target
launch date.</p>

<p>There are at least two aspects of localization to consider:</p>

<ul>
<li>Localizing the strings, images, and other resources in your app</li>
<li>Localizing you app's store listing details on Google Play</li>
</ul>

<p>To get started localizing your app, work with your development team to extract
any resource or coded strings for translation. Also identify images, icons, or
other assets that should be language- or locale-specific. Hand these off to  
a translator.</p>

<p>To localize your store listing, first create and finalize your app title, description, 
and promotional text. Collect and send all of these for localization. You can optionally
translate the "Recent Changes" text for app updates as well.</p>

<p>When your translations are complete, move them into your app resources as needed and test
that they are loaded properly. Save your app's translated listing details for later,
when you upload assets and configure your product details.</p>

</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h2 id="graphics">12. Prepare promotional graphics</h2>

<p>When you publish on Google Play, you can supply a variety of high-quality
graphic assets to showcase your app or brand. After you publish, these appear on
your product details page, in store listings and search results, and elsewhere.
These graphic assets are key parts of a successful product details page that
attracts and engages users, so you should consider having a professional produce
them for you. Screen shots and videos are also very important, because they show
what your app looks like, how it's used or played, and what makes it different.

<p>All of your graphic assets should be designed so that they are easy to see
and highlight your app or brand in a colorful, interesting way. The assets
should reference the same logo and icon as users will actually find in the All
Apps launcher once they have downloaded the app. Your graphic assets should also
fit in well with the graphic assets of other apps published by you, which will
be also be displayed to users on your product details page. </p>

<p>Because these assets are so important, you should get started on them well in
advance of your target publishing date. </p>

<h2 id="apk">13. Build and upload the release-ready APK</h2>

<p>When you are satisfied that your app meets your UI, compatibility, and
quality requirements, you can build the release-ready version of the app. The
release-ready APK is what you you will upload to the Developer Console and
distribute to users. 

<p>The process for preparing a release-ready APK is the same for all apps,
regardless of how they are distributed. Generally the process includes basic code cleanup
and optimization, building and signing with your release key, and final testing.
When you are finished preparing your application for release, you'll have a signed
APK file that you can upload to the Developer Console for distribution to
users. </p>

<p>For complete details on how to create a release-ready version of your app,
read <a href="{@docRoot}tools/publishing/preparing.html">Preparing for
Release</a>.</p>

<p>Once you have the release-ready APK in hand, you can upload it to 
the Developer Console. If necessary, you can replace the APK with a more 
recent version before publishing. </p>

<h2 id="product-page">14. Complete the app's product details</h2>

<p>On Google Play, your app's product information is shown to users on its
product details page, the page that users visit to learn more about your app and
the page from which they will decide to purchase or download your app, on their
Android devices or on the web.</p>

<p>Google Play gives you a variety of ways to promote your app and engage with
users on your product details page, from colorful graphics, screenshots, and
videos to localized descriptions, release details, and links to your other apps.
As you prepare to publish your app, make sure that you take advantage of all
that your product details page can offer, making your app as compelling as
possible to users.</p>

<p>You should begin planning your product page in advance of your target launch
date, arranging for localized description, high-quality graphic assets,
screenshots and video, and so on. </p>

<p>As you get near your target publishing date, you should become familiar with 
all the fields, options, and assets associated with the product details configuration
page in the Developer Console. As you collect the information and assets for the
page, make sure that you can enter or upload it to the Developer Console, until 
the page is complete and ready for publishing. </p>

<p>If your app is targeting tablet devices, make sure to include at least one screen
shot of the app running on a tablet, and highlight your app's support for tablets
in the app description, release notes, promotional campaigns, and elsewhere.</p>

<h2 id="badges">15. Use Google Play badges and links in your promotional
campaigns</h2>

<p>Google Play badges give you an officially branded way of promoting your app
to Android users. Use the <a
href="{@docRoot}distribute/googleplay/promote/badges.html">Google Play Badge
generator</a> to quickly create badges to link users to your products from web
pages, ads, reviews, and more. You can also use special <a
href="{@docRoot}distribute/googleplay/promote/linking.html">link formats</a>
to link directly to your product details page, to a list of your products, or to
search results.</p>

<p>To help your app get traction after launch, it's strongly recommended that you support 
launch with a promotional campaign that announces your product through many channels as
possible, in as many countries as possible. For example, you can promote the launch 
using ad placements, social network or blog posts, video and other media, interviews
and reviews, or any other channel available.</p>

<h2 id="support">17. Support users after launch</h2>

<p>After you publish an app or an app update, it's crucial for you to support
your customers. Prompt and courteous support can provide a better experience for
users that results in better ratings and more positive reviews for your
products. Users are likely to be more engaged with your app and recommend it if
you are responsive to their needs and feedback.  This is especially true after
publishing if you are using a coordinated promotional campaign.</p>

<p>There are a number of ways that you can keep in touch with users and offer
them support. The most fundamental is to provide your <em>support email
address</em> on your product details page. Beyond that, you can provide support
in any way you choose, such as a forum, mailing list or a Google+ page.  The
Google Play team does provide user support for downloading, installing and
payments issues, but issues that fall outside of these topics will fall under
your domain.  Examples of issues you can support include:  feature requests,
questions about using the app and questions about compatibility settings.  </p>

<p>After publishing, plan to: </p>
<ul>
<li>Check your ratings and reviews frequently on your app's product details
page. Watch for recurring issues that could signal bugs or other issues. </li>
<li>Be mindful of new Android platform version launches, as compatibility
settings for your apps might need to be updated.</li>
<li>Put a link to your support resources on your web site and set up any other
support such as forums.</li>
<li>Provide an appropriate support email address on your product details page
and respond to users when they take the time to email you.</li>
<li>Beyond the automatic refund window offered by Google Play, be generous with
your own refund policy, as satisfied users will be more likely to purchase in
the future. </li>
<li>Acknowledge and fix issues in your app. It helps to be transparent and
list known issues on your product details page proactively.  </li>
<li>Publish updates as frequently as you are able, without sacrificing quality
or annoying users with too-frequent updates. </li>
<li>With each update, make sure to provide a summary of what's changed. You can
enter this information in the Developer Console. Users will read it and
appreciate that you are serious about improving the quality of your app. </li>
</ul>
