<h2 id="participate">How to Participate</h2>

<div style="float:right; padding-top:2em;"><img
src="{@docRoot}images/gp-edu-process.png" /></div>

<p>Google Play for Education is a great way to put your educational apps in front of a
new audience of teachers and students. You can develop and publish using
familiar tools and processes, such as your existing <a
href="https://play.google.com/apps/publish/">Developer Console</a> account
and your current distribution and pricing settings. It's easy to participate
&mdash; the sections below outline the process.</p>

<h3 id="basic-info">1. Understand guidelines and policies</h3>

<p>To prepare for a successful launch on Google Play for Education, start by
reviewing the guidelines for educational apps in Google Play and the policies
that apply to your apps. See <a
href="{@docRoot}distribute/googleplay/edu/guidelines.html">Guidelines for
Apps</a> for details.</p>

<p>Also, make sure that your are familiar with the policies that your app must
comply with, including
<a href="http://play.google.com/about/developer-content-policy.html" target="_policies">content
policies</a>, the <a
href="http://play.google.com/about/developer-distribution-agreement.html"
target="_policies">developer agreement</a>,  and <a
href="https://play.google.com/about/developer-distribution-agreement-addendum.html"
target="_policies">Google Play for Education Addendum</a>.</p>

<h3 id="developing">2. Design and develop a great app for education</h3>

<p>A great app for educators and students is designed for classroom use, looks
great on tablets, and delivers a compelling feature set for teachers and
students. If you are developing an app for education, make sure that it is
appropriate for K-12 classrooms, offers educational value, and is refined to
offer a polished, high-quality tablet experience.</p>

<p>Assess your app against the criteria listed in <a
href="{@docRoot}distribute/googleplay/edu/guidelines.html">Guidelines for
Apps</a> and plan on supporting them to the greatest extent possible. In some
cases you might need to modify your features or UI to support the requirements
of the classroom use-case. It's a good idea to identify those areas early in
development so that you are able address them properly. </p>

<p>With Google Play for Education, optimizing your app for tablets is a crucial
part of getting your app ready for distribution to educators. A variety of
resources are available to help you understand what you need to optimize for
tablets &mdash; a good starting point is the <a
href="{@docRoot}distribute/googleplay/quality/tablet.html">Tablet App Quality
Guidelines</a>. </p>

<p>Throughout design and development, it's important to have a suitable device
on which to prototype and test your user experience. It's highly recommended
that you acquire one or more tablet devices and set up your testing environment
as early as possible. The recommended hardware device that replicates the Google
Play for Education environment is the Nexus 7, which is available from <a href="https://play.google.com/store/devices/details?id=nexus_7_16gb" target="_android">Google Play</a> and other stores.</p>

<p>Proper testing and quality assurance are key aspects of delivering a great
app for teachers and students. Make sure you set up a <a
href="{@docRoot}distribute/googleplay/edu/guidelines.html#test-environment">
proper test environment</a> to ensure that your app meets guidelines under
realistic conditions.</p>

the app is reviewed and approved, it then becomes available to educators in
Google Play for Education.</p>

<h3 id="review">4. Track your review and approval</h3>

<p>Google Play for Education provides content to educators in a way that's
properly organized by subject, grade level, and common core standards (where
applicable). To ensure high educational value and proper classification, we work
with a third-party educator network to review and approve apps before making
them discoverable through the Google Play for Education browsing tools. </p>

<p>Our third-party educator network will evaluate apps according to educational
value and alignment with K-12 core standards, then assign the metadata for
subject, grade level, and core curriculum that makes them easily browsable for
educators. To understand how your apps will be evaluated, please see the <a
href="{@docRoot}distribute/googleplay/edu/guidelines.html">Guidelines for
Apps</a> document.</p>

<p>As soon as you opt-in to Google Play for Education and publish, your app is
queued for review by our third-party educator network. The review and approval
process can take four weeks or more</strong>. You'll receive notification
by email (to your developer account address) when the review is complete, with a
summary of the review results. </p>

<p>At any time, you can check the review and approval status of your app in the
<a href="https://play.google.com/apps/publish/">Developer Console</a>, under
"Google Play for Education" in the app's Pricing and
Distribution page. There are three approval states:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Pending</em> &mdash; Your app was sent for review and the review
is not yet complete.</li>
<li><em>Approved</em> &mdash; Your app was reviewed and approved. The app
will be made available directly to educators through Google Play for Education.
Once your app is approved, you can update it at your convenience without needing
another full review. </li>
<li><em>Not approved</em> &mdash; Your app was reviewed and not approved.
Check the notification email for information about why the app was not approved.
You can address any issues and opt-in again for another review. </li>
</ul>

<p>If you have questions about the review status of your app, follow the process
discussed in the next section. </p>

<h3 id="appeal">5. Get support or appeal your review results</h3>

<p>After your app is reviewed you'll receive an email giving you the
results, including information on whether the app was approved and
what issues may need to be addressed. You'll receive the email at the address
you specified for your developer account. </p>

<p>If your app has issues that need to be addressed, make the necessary
adjustments, upload your app, and then resubmit the app to Google Play for
Education through the Developer Console using process described above. Your app
will be queued for review and you'll receive the review results by email just
as before.</p>
