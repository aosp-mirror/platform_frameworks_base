  The Family star button on Apps and Games Home points to an enhanced discovery
  experience for parents looking for family appropriate content. The new Family
  section includes uniquely merchandised content, new categories, and age-based
  browsing. Participating apps will receive this additional visibility on top
  of their existing categories, rankings, and reviews elsewhere on the Google
  Play store.
