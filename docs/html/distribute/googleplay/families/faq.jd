<dl>
<dt>How do I opt-in my app(s)?</dt>

<dl>
  <dd>
    You can opt-in to Designed for Families on the Pricing and Distribution tab
    for your app on the Google Play Developer Console. Here's a <a href=
    "{@docRoot}distribute/googleplay/families/start.html">step-by-step
    walkthrough</a>.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    Where do I disclose my app’s interactive features? Why are you collecting
    this information?
  </dt>

  <dd>
    Interactive feature disclosures are part of the content rating
    questionnaire. You have an opportunity to review your disclosures as
    part of the Designed for Families program opt-in flow. We collect this
    information so that users can make informed choices when evaluating your
    app.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    What is COPPA?
  </dt>

  <dd>
    COPPA is the Federal Trade Commission’s (FTC) Child Online Privacy
    Protection Rule. More details are available on the <a
    href="http://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/complying-coppa-frequently-asked-questions">
    FTC's FAQ about COPPA</a>. Note that Google Play cannot provide legal guidance to developers
    on how to comply with COPPA or other child statutes.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    Do I need to provide an up-to-date privacy policy and where do I do that?
  </dt>

  <dd>
    Yes, you need to provide a link to a persistent privacy policy on your
    app’s store listing and confirm your compliance with local privacy statutes
    in the Developer Console. To add or review your privacy policy, choose your
    app in the Developer Console and then scroll to the bottom of the
    <strong>Store Listing</strong> section.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    How many age groups can I select?
  </dt>

  <dd>
    You can select up to two adjacent age groups. Age groups are: Ages 5 &
    Under, Ages 6-8, and Ages 9-12. However, if your app targets audiences
    comprised of children and older audiences, you must select the <em>General
    Audience</em> category.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    How many content categories can I select in the Designed for Families
    program?
  </dt>

  <dd>
    You can select one category as part of the Designed for Families program
    and another category for the general Google Play store.
  </dd>

<dl>
  <dt>
    Will it take longer for my app to get published if I opt-in to the Designed
    for Families program?
  </dt>

  <dd>
    When you opt-in to Designed for Families, Google Play reviews your app to
    confirm that it is appropriate for families. Assuming your app complies with all program
    requirements, we expect that publishing time should not take any longer
    than normal; however, there may be a delay in publishing the app if it is
    rejected during the Designed for Families review. 
  </dd>

  <dt>
    What happens if my app is rejected from the Designed for Families program?
  </dt>

  <dd>
    If your app is rejected from the Designed for Families program, we’ll
    indicate why in the Developer Console and in a detailed email. You’ll have
    an opportunity to correct the issues and resubmit your app to the program,
    or change your opt-in response. Note that if you have an existing app that
    is live on Google Play, only your app update will be rejected (your app
    will remain live on the Play store). If you’ve submitted a new app to the
    Designed for Families program that does not meet the requirements, your
    entire app submission will be rejected and the app will not be published on
    Play. You can then address the identified issue(s) and resubmit the app for
    the Designed for Families program or opt-out of the program.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    What happens if my app is found to be non-compliant with Designed for
    Families program requirements after it has been published?
  </dt>

  <dd>
    Your app may be removed or suspended from the Google Play Store, not only
    the Designed for Families program. Removed apps can follow the same
    remedies as rejected apps. Suspended apps can be appealed using the
    developer appeal process.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    If I opt-in to the Designed for Families program, can I opt-out later on?
  </dt>

  <dd>
    Yes, you may opt-out of the program at any time. Please note that by opting
    out you would lose your placement in the new family-friendly experience as
    well as the other benefits of the program.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    What happens when I update my app after it has been accepted into the
    program?
  </dt>

  <dd>
    Apps that are part of the Designed for Families program need to maintain
    compliance with the eligibility requirements at all times. If you need to
    edit the Designed for Families metadata associated with your app, please go
    to the Pricing & Distribution section of the Google Play Developer Console
    to edit this information. If updating your app results in you changing your
    target audience, we recommend that you alert the users who already
    have your app installed.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    Can apps and games that use Google sign-in or Google Play Game
    services opt-into the Designed for Families program?
  </dt>

  <dd>
    Apps that participate in Designed for Families that are wholly
    child-focused, i.e. that target the following age groups: Ages 5 & Under,
    Ages 6 to 8, or Ages 9 to 12 <strong>may not</strong> use Google+ Sign-in
    or Google Play Game services as the login experience for their
    application.

    <p>
      Apps that participate in Designed for Families that target both children and
      older audiences, can use Google+ Sign-in or Google Play Game services as an
      <strong>optional</strong> feature. Child users must be able to access the app
      or game in its entirety without signing into Google+ or Google Play Game services.
    </p>
  </dd>

  <dt>
    My app is opted-in to Google Play for Education and has Google sign-in integration
    so that students can login with their school accounts. Do I need to change the way
    Google sign-in works in my app?
   </dt>

  <dd>
    Apps that participate in Google Play for Education may use Google sign-in for
    student accounts as long as it is not a blocking requirement for all users of the app.

    Families?
  </dt>

  <dd>
    Read the <a href=
    "https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/6184502#ads">
    ads policy for Designed for Families</a>.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    Can my app serve interstitial advertisements?
  </dt>

  <dd>
    Interstitial ads may be appropriate for some apps. However, a user must be
    able to navigate to the main activity before any ads are served.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    How do I know that my ad network complies with the advertising
    policies for Designed for Families?
  </dt>

  <dd>
    Please contact your advertising network to ask them about their content policies
    and advertising practices. If you use AdMob, then please refer to the <a href=
    "https://support.google.com/admob/answer/3248194">AdMob help center</a> for
    details on how to tag your app or a specific ad unit for child-directed
    treatment. It is the developer’s responsibility to ensure that the overall
    user experience with in-app advertising meets the <a href=
    "https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/6184502">Designed
    for Families program requirements</a>.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    Can I have in-app purchases in my app?
  </dt>

  <dd>
    There are no specific restrictions relating to in-app purchases (IAP) in
    apps participating in the Designed for Families program other than
    compliance with the <a href=
    "https://play.google.com/intl/ALL_us/about/families/developer-distribution-agreement-addendum.html">
    Designed for Families DDA</a> and other applicable legal requirements, but
    Play reserves the right to reject apps for overly aggressive commercial
    tactics. Google Play will enforce IAP password protection on all apps
    participating in the Designed for Families program that primarily target
    child audiences to ensure that parents, not children, are approving
    purchases. Please note that this treatment does not extend to apps
    targeting general audiences.
