<p>
  Keeping app content fresh is important to retaining users. And it’s easy with
  the popular <a href="{@docRoot}google/gcm/index.html">Google Cloud
  Messaging</a> for Android, by sending lightweight messages to your apps
  installed on Android devices anywhere in the world.
</p>

<p>
  Push messages from your backend servers to tell your apps that there's new
  content for the user, or other data to sync.
</p>

<p>
  You can use Google Cloud Messaging for two way messaging too. Another
  possibility is to improve the experience for users with multiple devices, by
  syncing content through the cloud so users have the same content on all their
  devices.
</p>

<p>
  Google Cloud Messaging lets your users stay in sync with your service without
  draining the user’s battery, as there's no need for your apps poll a server
  to discover new content. Best of all, Google Cloud Messaging is available for
  free and there are no quotas.
