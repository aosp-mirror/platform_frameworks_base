<p>A MapView allows you to create your own map-viewing Activity. 
First, we'll create a simple Activity that can view and navigate a map. Then we will add some overlay items.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Start a new project/Activity called HelloMapView.

   <li>Because we're using the Google Maps library, 
   which is not a part of the standard Android library, we need to 
   declare it in the Android Manifest. Open the AndroidManifest.xml 
   file and add the following as a child of the <code>&lt;application></code> element:

    <pre>&lt;uses-library android:name="com.google.android.maps" /></pre>
      </li>

   <li>Open the layout file. Define the layout with a MapView inside a RelativeLayout:

<pre>
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
&lt;RelativeLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    android:id="@+id/mainlayout"
    android:orientation="vertical"
    android:layout_width="fill_parent"
    android:layout_height="fill_parent" >

    &lt;com.google.android.maps.MapView
        android:id="@+id/mapview"
        android:layout_width="fill_parent"
        android:layout_height="fill_parent"
        android:clickable="true"
        android:apiKey="INSERT YOUR KEY HERE"
    />

&lt;RelativeLayout>
</pre>
      <p>Setting <code>clickable</code> is important. Otherwise, the map does not allow any user interaction.</p>

      <p>The <code>android:apiKey</code> must contain an authentic Android Maps API key.
      The API key is generated using the MD5 fingerprint of your application certificate. For the purposes of 
      this exercise, you should use the fingerprint of your debug certificate (which cannot be used to release
      your application for Android devices, but will work while developing). See how to 
      <a href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/geo/mapkey.html#getdebugfingerprint">generate a fingerprint from your 
      debug certificate</a>, then <a href="http://code.google.com/android/maps-api-signup.html">register the 
      certificate</a> to retieve an API key.
      Insert the API key as the value of the <code>apiKey</code> attribute. If you do not insert a valid
      Maps API key, the application will still run, but no map tiles will load.</p></li>

   <li>Now open the HelloMapView.java file. For this Activity, we're going to extend the special sub-class of 
      Activity called MapActivity, so change the class declaration to extend 
      MapActicity, instead of Activity:</p>

      <pre>public class HelloMapView extends MapActivity {</pre>

   <li>The <code>isRouteDisplayed()</code> method is required, so add it inside the class:
<pre>
&#64;Override
protected boolean isRouteDisplayed() {
    return false;
}
</pre>
<p>You can actually run this now, but all it does is allow you to pan around the map.</p>
<p>Android provides a handy {@link android.widget.ZoomControls} widget for zooming in and out of a View. 
MapView can automatically hook one for us by requesting it with the <code>getZoomControls()</code>
method. Let's do this.</p>

<li>Go back to the layout file. We need a new ViewGroup element, in which we'll 
   place the ZoomControls. Just below the MapView element (but inside the RelativeLayout), add this element:
<pre>
&lt;LinearLayout
    android:id="@+id/zoomview"
    android:layout_width="wrap_content"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    android:layout_alignBottom="@id/mapview"
    android:layout_centerHorizontal="true"
/></pre>

      <p>It doesn't really matter what kind of ViewGroup we use, because we just want a 
      container that we can position within our root RelativeLayout.</p>

      <p>The last two attributes are available only to an element that's a child of a 
      RelativeLayout. <code>layout_alignBottom</code> aligns the bottom of this element to the bottom of 
      the element identified with a resource tag (which must be a sibling to this element). 
      <code>layout_centerHorizontal</code> centers this on the horizontal plane.</p></li>

   <li>Now go back to the HelloMapView class. We'll now retrieve the ZoomControls object from 
   the MapView and add it to our new layout element. First, at the top of the HelloMapView, 
   instantiate handles for the MapView and LinearLayout, plus a ZoomControl object:
<pre>
LinearLayout linearLayout;
MapView mapView;
ZoomControls mZoom;</pre></li>

   <li>Then initialize each of these in <code>onCreate()</code>. We'll capture the LinearLayout and 
   MapView through their layout resources. Then get the ZoomControls from the MapView::
<pre>
linearLayout = (LinearLayout) findViewById(R.id.zoomview);
mapView = (MapView) findViewById(R.id.mapview);
mZoom = (ZoomControls) mapView.getZoomControls();</pre>

      <p>By using the ZoomControls object provided by MapView, we don't have to do any of the work
      required to actually perform the zoom operations. The ZoomControls widget that MapView 
      returns for us is already hooked into the MapView and works as soon as we add it to the 
      layout. The controls will appear whenever the user touches the map, then dissapear after 
      a few moments of inactivity.</p></li>

   <li>Now just plug our ZoomControls into the LinearLayout we added:

      <pre>linearLayout.addView(mZoom);</pre></li>

   <li>Run it.</li>
</ol>

<hr/>

<p>So, we now have full interaction controls. All well and good, but what we really want our map 
for is custom markers and layovers. Let's add some Overlay 
objects to our map. To do this, we're going to 
implement the ItemizedOverlay
class, which can manage a whole set of Overlay items for us.</p>

<ol>   
  <li>Create a new Java class named HelloItemizedOverlay that implements ItemizedOverlay.

      <p>When using Eclipse, right-click the package name in the Eclipse Package Explorer, and select New > Class. Fill-in 
      the Name field as <em>HelloItemizedOverlay</em>. For the Superclass, enter 
      <em>com.google.android.maps.ItemizedOverlay</em>. Click the checkbox for <em>Constructors from 
      superclass</em>. Click Finish.</p></li>

  <li> First thing, we need an OverlayItem ArrayList, in which we'll put each of the OverlayItem 
   objects we want on our map. Add this at the top of the HelloItemizedOverlay class:

      <pre>private ArrayList&lt;OverlayItem> mOverlays = new ArrayList&lt;OverlayItem>();</pre></li>

   <li>All the constructor does is define the default marker to be used on each of the OverlayItems. 
   In order for the Drawable to actually get drawn, it must have its bounds defined. And we want the 
   center-point at the bottom of the image to be the point at which it's attached to the map 
   coordinates. We handle all this with the boundCenterBottom() method. Wrap this around our 
   defaultMarker, so the super constructor call looks like this:

      <pre>super(boundCenterBottom(defaultMarker));</pre></li>

   <li>In order to add new OverlayItems to our ArrayList, we need a new public method. We'll handle 
   this with the following method:

<pre>
public void addOverlay(OverlayItem overlay) {
    mOverlays.add(overlay);
    populate();
}</pre>

      <p>Each time we add a new OverlayItem, we must call <code>populate()</code>, which will read each of out 
      OverlayItems and prepare them to be drawn.</p></li>

   <li>In order for the <code>populate()</code> method to read each OverlayItem, it will make a request to 
   <code>createItem(int)</code>. We must define this method to properly read from our ArrayList. Replace the 
   existing contents of the createItem method with a <code>get()</code> call to our ArrayList:

<pre>
&#64;Override
protected OverlayItem createItem(int i) {
  return mOverlays.get(i);
}
</pre></li>

   <li>We're also required to override the <code>size()</code> method. Replace the existing contents of the 
   method with a size request to our ArrayList:

      <pre>return mOverlays.size();</pre></li>
</ol>


<p>That's it for the HelloItemizedOverlay class. We're now ready to use it.</p>

<hr/>
<p>Go back to the HelloMapView 
class. We'll start by creating one OverlayItem, adding to an instance of our HelloItemizedOverlay, 
and then adding this to the MapView.</p>

<img src="images/androidmarker.png" align="right" />
<p>First, we need the image that we'll use for our map overlay. Here, we'll use the Android on the 
right as our marker. Drag this image (or your own) to the res/drawable/ directory of your project workspace.</p>

<p>Now we're ready to work in the HelloMapView:</p>

<ol>
   <li>First we need some more types. Add the following at the top of the HelloMapView class:

<pre>
List&lt;Overlay> mapOverlays;
Drawable drawable;
HelloItemizedOverlay itemizedOverlay;</pre></li>

   <li>Now pick up where we left off in the <code>onCreate()</code> method. Instantiate the 
   new fields:

<pre>
mapOverlays = mapView.getOverlays();
drawable = this.getResources().getDrawable(R.drawable.androidmarker);
itemizedoverlay = new HelloItemizedOverlay(drawable);</pre>

      <p>All overlay elements on a map are held by the MapView, so when we want to add some, we must 
      first retrieve the List with <code>getOverlays()</code> methods. We instantiate the Drawable, which will 
      be used as our map marker, by using our Context resources to get the Drawable we placed in 
      the res/drawable/ directory (androidmarker.png). Our HelloItemizedOverlay takes the Drawable in order to set the 
      default marker.</p></li>

   <li>Now let's make our first OverlayItem by creating a GeoPoint
    that defines our map coordinates, then pass it to a new OverlayItem:

<pre>
GeoPoint point = new GeoPoint(19240000,-99120000);
OverlayItem overlayitem = new OverlayItem(point, "", "");</pre>

      <p>GeoPoint coordinates are based in microdegrees (degrees * 1e6). The OverlayItem takes this 
      GeoPoint and two strings. Here, we won't concern ourselves with the strings, which can display 
      text when we click our marker, because we haven't yet written the click handler for the OverlayItem.</p></li>

   <li>All that's left is for us to add this OverlayItem to our collection in the HelloItemizedOverlay, 
   and add this to the List of Overlay objects retrieved from the MapView:

<pre>
itemizedoverlay.addOverlay(overlayitem);
mapOverlays.add(itemizedoverlay);</pre></li>

   <li>Run it!</li>
</ol>

<p>We've sent our droid to Mexico City. Hola, Mundo!</p>
<p>You should see the following:</p>
<img src="images/hello-mapview.png" width="150px" />

<p>Because we created our ItemizedOverlay class with an ArrayList, we can continue adding new
OverlayItems. Try adding another one. Before the <code>addOverlay()</code> method is called, add these lines:</p>
<pre>
GeoPoint point2 = new GeoPoint(35410000, 139460000);
OverlayItem overlayitem2 = new OverlayItem(point2, "", "");
</pre>
<p>Run it again... We've sent a new droid to Tokyo. Sekai, konichiwa!</p>
