    This topic explains how create and run tests of Android applications in Eclipse with ADT.
    Before you read this topic, you should read about how to create a Android application with the
    basic processes for creating and running applications with ADT, as described in
    <a href="{@docRoot}guide/developing/eclipse-adt.html">Developing In Eclipse, with ADT</a>.
    You may also want to read
    <a href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/testing/testing_android.html">Testing Fundamentals</a>,
    which provides an overview of the Android testing framework.
</p>
<p>
    ADT provides several features that help you set up and manage your testing environment
    effectively:
</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            It lets you quickly create a test project and link it to the application under test.
            When it creates the test project, it automatically inserts the necessary
            <code>&lt;instrumentation&gt;</code> element in the test package's manifest file.
        </li>
        <li>
            It lets you quickly import the classes of the application under test, so that your
            tests can inspect them.
        </li>
        <li>
            It lets you create run configurations for your test package and include in
            them flags that are passed to the Android testing framework.
        </li>
        <li>
            It lets you run your test package without leaving Eclipse. ADT builds both the
            application under test and the test package automatically, installs them if
            necessary to your device or emulator, runs the test package, and displays the
            results in a separate window in Eclipse.
        </li>
    </ul>
<p>
    If you are not developing in Eclipse or you want to learn how to create and run tests from the
    command line, see
    <a href="{@docRoot}guide/developing/testing/testing_otheride.html">Testing in Other IDEs</a>.
</p>
<h2 id="CreateTestProjectEclipse">Creating a Test Project</h2>
<p>
    To set up a test environment for your Android application, you must first create a separate
    project that holds the test code. The new project follows the directory structure
    used for any Android application. It includes the same types of content and files, such as
    source code, resources, a manifest file, and so forth. The test package you
    create is connected to the application under test by an
    <a href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/manifest/instrumentation-element.html">
    <code>&lt;instrumentation&gt;</code></a> element in its manifest file.
</p>
<p>
    The <em>New Android Test Project</em> dialog makes it easy for you to generate a
    new test project that has the proper structure, including the
    <code>&lt;instrumentation&gt;</code> element in the manifest file. You can use the New
    Android Test Project dialog to generate the test project at any time. The dialog appears
    just after you create a new Android main application project, but you can also run it to
    create a test project for a project that you created previously.
</p>
<p>
    To create a test project in Eclipse with ADT:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        In Eclipse, select <strong>File &gt; New &gt; Other</strong>. This opens the <em>Select a
        Wizard</em> dialog.
    </li>
    <li>
        In the dialog, in the <em>Wizards</em> drop-down list, find the entry for Android, then
        click the toggle to the left. Select <strong>Android Test Project</strong>, then at the
        bottom of the dialog click <strong>Next</strong>. The <em>New Android Test Project</em>
        wizard appears.
    </li>
    <li>
        Next to <em>Test Project Name</em>, enter a name for the project. You may use any name,
        but you may want to associate the name with the project name for the application under test.
        One way to do this is to take the application's project name, append the string "Test" to
        it, and then use this as the test package project name.
        <p>
            The name becomes part of the suggested project path, but you can change this in the
            next step.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        In the <em>Content</em> panel, examine the suggested path to the project.
        If <em>Use default location</em> is set, then the wizard will suggest a path that is
        a concatenation of the workspace path and the project name you entered. For example,
        if your workspace path is <code>/usr/local/workspace</code> and your project name is
        <code>MyTestApp</code>, then the wizard will suggest
        <code>/usr/local/workspace/MyTestApp</code>. To enter your own
        choice for a path, unselect <em>Use default location</em>, then enter or browse to the
        path where you want your project.
        <p>
            To learn more about choosing the location of test projects, please read
            <a href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/testing/testing_android.html#TestProjectPaths">
            Testing Fundamentals</a>.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        In the Test Target panel, set An Existing Android Project, click Browse, then select your
        Android application from the list. You now see that the wizard has completed the Test
        Target Package, Application Name, and Package Name fields for you (the latter two are in
        the Properties panel).
    </li>
    <li>
        In the Build Target panel, select the Android SDK platform that the application under test
        uses.
    </li>
    <li>
        Click Finish to complete the wizard. If Finish is disabled, look for error messages at the
        top of the wizard dialog, and then fix any problems.
    </li>
</ol>
<h2 id="CreateTestAppEclipse">Creating a Test Package</h2>
<p>
    Once you have created a test project, you populate it with a test package. This package does not
    require an Activity, although you can define one if you wish. Although your test package can
    combine Activity classes, test case classes, or ordinary classes, your main test case
    should extend one of the Android test case classes or JUnit classes, because these provide the
    best testing features.
</p>
<p>
    Test packages do not need to have an Android GUI. When you run the package in
    Eclipse with ADT, its results appear in the JUnit view. Running tests and seeing the results is
    described in more detail in the section <a href="#RunTestEclipse">Running Tests</a>.
</p>

<p>
    To create a test package, start with one of Android's test case classes defined in
    {@link android.test android.test}. These extend the JUnit
    {@link junit.framework.TestCase TestCase} class. The Android test classes for Activity objects
    also provide instrumentation for testing an Activity. To learn more about test case
    classes, please read the topic <a href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/testing/testing_android.html">
    Testing Fundamentals</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Before you create your test package, you choose the Java package identifier you want to use
    for your test case classes and the Android package name you want to use. To learn more
    about this, please read
    <a href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/testing/testing_android.html#PackageNames">
    Testing Fundamentals</a>.
</p>
<p>
    To add a test case class to your project:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        In the <em>Project Explorer</em> tab, open your test project, then open the <em>src</em>
        folder.
    </li>
    <li>
        Find the Java package identifier set by the projection creation wizard. If you haven't
        added classes yet, this node won't have any children, and its icon will not be filled in.
        If you want to change the identifier value, right-click the identifier and select
        <strong>Refactor</strong> &gt; <strong>Rename</strong>, then enter the new name.
    </li>
    <li>
        When you are ready, right-click the Java package identifier again and select
        <strong>New</strong> &gt; <strong>Class</strong>. This displays the <em>New Java Class</em>
        dialog, with the <em>Source folder</em> and <em>Package</em> values already set.
    </li>
    <li>
        In the <em>Name</em> field, enter a name for the test case class. One way to choose a
        class name is to append the string "Test" to the class of the component you are testing.
        For example, if you are testing the class MyAppActivity, your test case class
        name would be MyAppActivityTest. Leave the modifiers set to <em>public</em>.
    </li>
    <li>
        In the <em>Superclass</em> field, enter the name of the Android test case class you
        are extending. You can also browse the available classes.
    </li>
    <li>
        In <em>Which method stubs would you like to create?</em>, unset all the options, then
        click <strong>Finish</strong>. You will set up the constructor manually.
    </li>
    <li>
        Your new class appears in a new Java editor pane.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    You now have to ensure that the constructor is set up correctly. Create a constructor for your
    class that has no arguments; this is required by JUnit. As the first statement in this
    constructor, add a call to the base class' constructor. Each base test case class has its
    own constructor signature. Refer to the class documentation in the documentation for
    {@link android.test} for more information.
</p>
<p>
    To control your test environment, you will want to override the <code>setUp()</code> and
    <code>tearDown()</code> methods:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <code>setUp()</code>: This method is invoked before any of the test methods in the class.
        Use it to set up the environment for the test (the test fixture. You can use
        <code>setUp()</code> to instantiate a new Intent with the action <code>ACTION_MAIN</code>.
        You can then use this intent to start the Activity under test.
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>tearDown()</code>: This method is invoked after all the test methods in the class. Use
        it to do garbage collection and to reset the test fixture.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Another useful convention is to add the method <code>testPreconditions()</code> to your test
    class. Use this method to test that the application under test is initialized correctly. If this
    test fails, you know that that the initial conditions were in error. When this happens, further
    test results are suspect, regardless of whether or not the tests succeeded.

            <h2>Running tests from the command line</h2>
                <p>
                    If you've created your tests in Eclipse, you can still run your tests and test
                    suites by using command-line tools included with the Android SDK. You may want
                    to do this, for example, if you have a large number of tests to run, if you
                    have a large test case, or if you want a fine level of control over which
                    tests are run at a particular time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To run tests created in Eclipse with ADT with command-line tools, you must first
                    install additional files into the test project using the <code>android</code>
                    tool's "create test-project" option. To see how to do this, read
                   <a href="{@docRoot}guide/developing/testing/testing_otheride.html#CreateProject">
                    Testing in Other IDEs</a>.
                </p>
        </div>
    </div>
<p>
    When you run a test package in Eclipse with ADT, the output appears in the Eclipse JUnit view.
    You can run the entire test package or one test case class. To do run tests, Eclipse runs the
    <code>adb</code> command for running a test package, and displays the output, so there is no
    difference between running tests inside Eclipse and running them from the command line.
</p>
<p>
    As with any other package, to run a test package in Eclipse with ADT you must either attach a
    device to your computer or use the Android emulator. If you use the emulator, you must have an
    Android Virtual Device (AVD) that uses the same target as the test package.
</p>
<p>
    To run a test in Eclipse, you have two choices:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Run a test just as you run an application, by selecting
        <strong>Run As... &gt; Android JUnit Test</strong> from the project's context menu or
        from the main menu's <strong>Run</strong> item.
    </li>
    <li>
        Create an Eclipse run configuration for your test project. This is useful if you want
        multiple test suites, each consisting of selected tests from the project. To run
        a test suite, you run the test configuration.
        <p>
            Creating and running test configurations is described in the next section.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    To create and run a test suite using a run configuration:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        In the Package Explorer, select the test project, then from the main menu, select
        <strong>Run &gt; Run Configurations...</strong>. The Run Configurations dialog appears.
    </li>
    <li>
        In the left-hand pane, find the Android JUnit Test entry. In the right-hand pane, click the
        Test tab. The Name: text box shows the name of your project. The Test class: dropdown box
        shows one of the test classes in your project.
    </li>
    <li>
        To run one test class, click  Run a single test, then enter your project name in the
        Project: text box and the class name in the Test class: text box.
        <p>
            To run all the test classes, click Run all tests in the selected project or package,
            then enter the project or package name in the text box.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        Now click the Target tab.
        <ul>
            <li>
                Optional: If you are using the emulator, click Automatic, then in the Android
                Virtual Device (AVD) selection table, select an existing AVD.
            </li>
            <li>
                In the Emulator Launch Parameters pane, set the Android emulator flags you want to
                use. These are documented in the topic
                <a href="{@docRoot}guide/developing/tools/emulator.html#startup-options">
                Android Emulator</a>.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Click the Common tab. In the Save As pane, click Local to save this run configuration
        locally, or click Shared to save it to another project.
    </li>
    <li>
        Optional: Add the configuration to the Run toolbar and the <strong>Favorites</strong>
        menu: in the Display in Favorites pane click the checkbox next to Run.
    </li>
    <li>
        Optional: To add this configuration to the <strong>Debug</strong> menu and toolbar, click
        the checkbox next to Debug.
    </li>
    <li>
        To save your settings, click Close.<br/>
        <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong>
            Although you can run the test immediately by clicking Run, you should save the test
            first and then run it by selecting it from the Eclipse standard toolbar.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        On the Eclipse standard toolbar, click the down arrow next to the green Run arrow. This
        displays a menu of saved Run and Debug configurations.
    </li>
    <li>
        Select the test run configuration you just created. The test starts.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    The progress of your test appears in the Console view as a series of messages. Each message is
    preceded by a timestamp and the <code>.apk</code> filename to which it applies. For example,
    this message appears when you run a test to the emulator, and the emulator is not yet started:

        Number of runs (Runs:) - the number of tests in the entire test class.
    </li>
    <li>
        Number of errors (Errors:) - the number of program errors and exceptions encountered
        during the test run.
    </li>
    <li>
        Number of failures (Failures:) - the number of test failures encountered during the test
        run. This is the number of assertion failures. A test can fail even if the program does
        not encounter an error.
    </li>
    <li>
        A progress bar. The progress bar extends from left to right as the tests run. If all the
        tests succeed, the bar remains green. If a test fails, the bar turns from green to red.

    The body of the upper pane contains the details of the test run. For each test case class
    that was run, you see a line with the class name. To look at the results for the individual
    test methods in that class, you click the left arrow to expand the line. You now see a
    line for each test method in the class, and to its right the time it took to run.
    If you double-click the method name, Eclipse opens the test class source in an editor view
    pane and moves the focus to the first line of the test method.

    The results of a successful test are shown in figure 1.

    The lower pane is for stack traces. If you highlight a failed test in the upper pane, the
    lower pane contains a stack trace for the test. If a line corresponds to a point in your
    test code, you can double-click it to display the code in an editor view pane, with the
    line highlighted. For a successful test, the lower pane is empty.
