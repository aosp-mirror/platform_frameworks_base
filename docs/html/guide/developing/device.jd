<p>When building a mobile application, it's important that you always test your application on a
real device before releasing it to users. This page describes how to set up your development
environment and Android-powered device for testing and debugging on the device.</p>

<p>You can use any Android-powered device as an environment for running,
debugging, and testing your applications. The tools included in the SDK make it easy to install and
run your application on the device each time you compile. You can install your application on the
device directly from Eclipse or from the command line with ADB. If
you don't yet have a device, check with the service providers in your area to determine which
Android-powered devices are available.</p>

<p>If you want a SIM-unlocked phone, then you might consider the Google Nexus S. To find a place
to purchase the Nexus S and other Android-powered devices, visit <a
href="http://www.google.com/phone/detail/nexus-s">google.com/phone</a>.</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> When developing on a device, keep in mind that you should
still use the <a
href="{@docRoot}guide/developing/devices/emulator.html">Android emulator</a> to test your
application
on configurations that are not equivalent to those of your real device. Although the emulator
does not allow you to test every device feature (such as the accelerometer), it does
allow you to verify that your application functions properly on different versions of the Android
platform, in different screen sizes and orientations, and more.</p>


<h2 id="setting-up">Setting up a Device for Development</h2>

<p>With an Android-powered device, you can develop and debug your Android applications just as you
would on the emulator. Before you can start, there are just a few things to do:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Declare your application as "debuggable" in your Android Manifest.
    <p>In Eclipse, you can do this from the <b>Application</b> tab when viewing the Manifest
    (on the right side, set <b>Debuggable</b> to <em>true</em>). Otherwise, in the
<code>AndroidManifest.xml</code>
    file, add <code>android:debuggable="true"</code> to the <code>&lt;application></code>
element.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Set up your device to allow installation of non-Market applications. <p>On
the device, go to <strong>Settings > Applications</strong> and enable 

<strong>Unknown sources</strong> (on an Android 4.0 device, the setting is
located in <strong>Settings > Security</strong>).</p>
  
  </li>
  <li>Turn on "USB Debugging" on your device.
    <p>On the device, go to <strong>Settings > Applications > Development</strong> 
    and enable <strong>USB debugging</strong> 
    (on an Android 4.0 device, the setting is 
located in <strong>Settings > Developer options</strong>).</p>
  </li>
  <li>Set up your system to detect your device.
    <ul>
      <li>If you're developing on Windows, you need to install a USB driver
      for adb. If you're using an Android Developer Phone (ADP), Nexus One, or Nexus S,
      see the <a href="{@docRoot}sdk/win-usb.html">Google Windows USB
      Driver</a>. Otherwise, you can find a link to the appropriate OEM driver in the
  <a href="{@docRoot}sdk/oem-usb.html">OEM USB Drivers</a> document.</li>
      <li>If you're developing on Mac OS X, it just works. Skip this step.</li>
      
      <li>If you're developing on Ubuntu Linux, you need to add a <a
href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/udev.html">
<code>udev</code></a> 
rules file that contains a USB configuration for each type of device
you want to use for development. In the rules file, each device manufacturer
is identified by a unique vendor ID, as specified by the
<code>ATTR{idVendor}</code> property. For a list of vendor IDs, see  <a
href="#VendorIds">USB Vendor IDs</a>, below. To set up device detection on
Ubuntu Linux:

        <ol type="a">
          <li>Log in as root and create this file:
            <code>/etc/udev/rules.d/51-android.rules</code></span>.
            <p>Use this format to add each vendor to the file:<br/>
              <code>SUBSYSTEM==&quot;usb&quot;, ATTR{idVendor}==&quot;0bb4&quot;, MODE=&quot;0666&quot;, GROUP=&quot;plugdev&quot;</code>
              <br /><br />
              
              In this example, the vendor ID is for HTC. The <code>MODE</code>
assignment specifies read/write permissions, and <code>GROUP</code> defines
which Unix group  owns the device node. </p>
            
            <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> The rule syntax
may vary slightly depending on your  environment. Consult the <code>udev</code>
documentation for your system as needed. For an overview of rule syntax, see
this guide to <a
href="http://www.reactivated.net/writing_udev_rules.html">writing udev
rules</a>.</p>
          </li>
          <li>Now execute:<br/>
            <code>chmod a+r /etc/udev/rules.d/51-android.rules</code>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>You can verify that your device is connected by executing <code>adb
devices</code> from your SDK {@code platform-tools/} directory. If connected,
you'll see the device name listed as a "device."</p>

<p>If using Eclipse, run or debug your application as usual. You will be
presented with a <b>Device Chooser</b> dialog that lists the available
emulator(s) and connected device(s). Select the device upon which you want to
install and run the application.</p>

<p>If using the <a href="{@docRoot}guide/developing/tools/adb.html">Android
Debug Bridge</a> (adb), you can issue commands with the <code>-d</code> flag to
target your connected device.</p>

<h3 id="VendorIds">USB Vendor IDs</h3>

<p>This table provides a reference to the vendor IDs needed in order to add USB
device support on Linux. The USB Vendor ID is the value given to the
<code>ATTR{idVendor}</code> property in the rules file, as described 
above.</p>
