<p>All applications written for Android 1.5 or earlier, by default, support only the
baseline HVGA screen used on the T-Mobile G1 and similar devices, which is <em>normal</em> screen
size and medium density (<em>mdpi</em>). Android 1.6 introduced support for different screen
configurations and added APIs that allow applications to control how they operate on different
screens, using alternative resources for different screen configurations.</p>

<p>If your manifest file includes the <a
href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element.html">{@code &lt;uses-sdk&gt;}</a> element,
with the <a
href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element.html#min">{@code android:minSdkVersion}</a>
attribute set to {@code "3"} or lower, and does <em>not</em> include the <a
href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element.html#target">{@code
android:targetSdkVersion}</a> set to {@code "4"} or higher, then this document is for you. By
default, an application written for Android 1.5 or below that does not set the <a
href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element.html#target">{@code
android:targetSdkVersion}</a> set to {@code "4"} or higher runs in <a
href="screen-compat-mode.html">screen compatibility mode</a> when on a device with a screen larger than
the
<em>normal</em> screen size (basically, the system displays the application in a small window
that is roughly the size of the normal screen size).</p>

<p>This document describes how to get your application out of <a
href="screen-compat-mode.html">screen compatibility
mode</a> and instead support multiple screens, but also maintain compatibility with Android 1.5 and
below.</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Before you begin, you should first decide whether it's even
necessary to support Android 1.5. To see the relative number of devices that are still running
Android 1.5, see the <a
href="http://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/index.html">Platform Versions
Dashboard</a>.</p>




<h2 id="strategies">Adding Multiple Screens Support</h2>

<p>If you have already developed and published an Android application based on
Android 1.5 or earlier platform version, and want to maintain compatibility with Android 1.5, you
need to make some changes to your application in order for it to properly run on newer devices with
different screen configurations. You should be able to make these changes to your application such
that you can distribute a single {@code .apk} to all devices.</p>

<p>The recommended strategy is to develop your application against Android 1.6 (because it's the
lowest version that includes support for multiple screens) and test your application on each
platform version your application supports (especially the minimum platform, such as Android 1.5).
Here's how to do that:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Maintain compatibility with existing devices by leaving your application's <a
href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element.html#min">{@code android:minSdkVersion}</a>
attribute as it is. You <em>do not</em> need to increment the value of the attribute to support new
devices and multiple screens. </li>
  <li>Extend compatibility for Android 1.6 (and higher) devices by adding <a
href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element.html#target">{@code
android:targetSdkVersion}</a> to the <a
href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element.html">{@code &lt;uses-sdk&gt;}</a> element.
Set the value of <a href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element.html#target">{@code
android:targetSdkVersion}</a> to <code>"4"</code>. This allows your application to "inherit" the
platform's multiple screens support, even though it is technically using an earlier version of the
API.
  <p>Adding this attribute will cause an error in the compiler, because the attribute is unknown to
Android 1.5. You'll fix this next.</p></li>
  <li>Change your application's build properties, such that it compiles against the Android 1.6 (API
Level 4) library, rather than against the Android 1.5 (or earlier) library. You must do this in
order for your application to successfully compile when using the new manifest attributes. Older
versions of the platform simply ignore the attributes they don't know, so your application still
runs fine on them, as long as you don't use APIs in your application code from Android 1.6. </li>
</ol>

<p>Your application is now prepared to run on multiple screens, while maintaining support for
Android 1.5 or lower.</p>

<p>Here's how you should begin testing your application:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Set up AVDs for testing your application on Android 1.6 and some new versions. Create AVDs
that use the screen sizes and densities that you want to support. When you create the AVDs, make
sure to select the Android 1.6 or higher platform as the system image to use. For more information,
see <a href="{@docRoot}guide/practices/screens_support.html#testing">How to Test Your Application on
Multiple Screens</a>.</li>
  <li>Set up AVDs for testing your application on older versions of the platform, as low as the
version declared by your <a
href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element.html#min">{@code android:minSdkVersion}</a>.
You need AVDs running the older platforms you are targeting, so that you can ensure there are
no functional regressions.</li>
  <li>Compile your application against the Android 1.6 library and run it on the AVDs you created.
Observe the way your application looks and runs, and test all of the user interactions.</li>
  <li>Debug any display or functional issues. For issues that you resolve in
your application code, <span style="color:red">make certain not to use any APIs
introduced later than the version declared by your <a
href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element.html#min">{@code
android:minSdkVersion}</a></span>. If you
are in doubt, refer to SDK reference documentation and look for the API Level specifier for the API
you want to use. Using newer APIs not supported by your minimum version will mean that your
application will no longer be compatible with devices running on that version.</li>
</ol>

<p>In particular, remember to test your application on an AVD that emulates a small-screen device.
Users of devices with QVGA resolution at low density may want to download your application, so you
should understand how your application will look and function on a small-screen device. In some
cases, the reduced screen area and density mean that you need to make tradeoffs in design on those
devices.</p>

<p>Also give extra attention to testing your application on an AVD that emulates an <em>xlarge</em>
screen. Devices with extra large screens are tablet-sized or larger, so you should pay close
attention to how usable your application is on such screens. You might want to design new layouts
specifically for extra large screens, to address usability aspects such as the location and size of
buttons in your UI. To test your application on an extra large screen, create an AVD targeted to
Android 3.0 and use the WXGA emulator skin.</p>

<p>Once you've completed the procedures above, you should follow the recommendations in <a
href="{@docRoot}guide/practices/screens_support.html">Supporting Multiple Screens</a> to add
complete support for different screen configurations.</p>
