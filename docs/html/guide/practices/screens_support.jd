<p>Android is designed to run on a variety of devices that offer a range of
screen sizes and resolutions. For applications, the platform provides a
consistent environment across devices and handles much of the complexity of
adapting an application's UI to the screen on which it is being displayed. At
the same time, the platform exposes APIs that give application developers
precise control over their application's UI when displayed on specific screen
sizes and resolutions. </p>

<p>This document explains the screens-support features provided by the platform
and how you use them in your application. By following the practices described
here, you can easily create an application that displays properly on all
supported device screens and that you can deploy to any device as a single .apk.
</p>

<p>If you have already developed and published an application for Android 1.5 or
earlier, you should read this document and consider how you may need to adapt
your application for proper display on new devices that offer different screens
and that are running Android 1.6 or later. In most cases, only minor adjustments
are needed, however you should make sure to <a href="#testing">test your
application</a> on all of the new screens supported in Android 1.6. 

<!--See <a href="#migrating">Migrating</a> for strategies e you can continue using the previous API level and use target API level, or you can just compile. --></p>

<p>In particular, if you have an existing application that you would like to
make available for users of devices with small screens (such as QVGA), please
see <a href="#strategies">Strategies for Legacy Applications</a> for more
information about how to do that. </p>


<h2 id="overview">Overview of Screens Support</h2>

<p>The sections below provide an overview of the Android platform's support for multiple screens, including an introduction to terms and concepts used in this document and in the API, a summary of the screen configurations that the platform supports, and an overview of the API and underlying screen-compatibility features.</p>


<h3>Terms and Concepts</h3>

<dl>
<dt><em>Screen size</em></dt>
  <dd>Actual physical size, measured as the screen's diagonal. 

  <p>For simplicity, Android collapses all actual screen sizes into three
generalized sizes: large, normal, and small. Applications can provide custom
layouts for each of these three sizes &mdash; the platform transparently handles
the rendering of the layouts at the actual screen size.</p></dd>

<dt><em>Aspect ratio</em></dt>
  <dd>The porportional relationship of the screen's physical width to its
height. Applications can provide layout resources for specific aspect ratios by
using the resource qualifiers <code>long</code> and <code>notlong</code>. </dd>

<dt><em>Resolution</em></dt>
  <dd>The total number of physical pixels on a screen. Note that, although
resolution is often expressed as <em>width</em> x <em>height</em>, resolution
does not imply a specific aspect ratio. In Android, applications do not work
directly with resolution.</dd>

<dt><em>Density</em></dt>
  <dd>Based on the screen resolution, the spread of pixels across the physical
width and height of the screen.

  <p>A screen with lower density has fewer available pixels spread across the
screen width and height, where a screen with higher density has more &mdash;
sometimes significantly more &mdash; pixels spread across the same area. The
density of a screen is important because, other things being equal, a UI element
(such as a button) whose height and width are defined in terms of screen pixels
will appear larger on the lower density screen and smaller on the higher density
screen. </p>

  <p>For simplicity, Android collapses all actual screen densities into three
generalized densities: high, medium, and low. Applications can provide custom
resources for each of these three densities &mdash; the platform handles the
scaling of the resources up or down to meet the actual screen density. </p></dd>
<dt><em>Density independent pixel (dip)</em></dt>
  <dd>A virtual pixel unit that applications can use in defining their UI, to
express layout dimensions or position in a density-independent way. 
  <p>The density-independent pixel is equivalent to one physical pixel on a 160
dpi screen, the baseline density assumed by the platform (as described later in
this document). At run time, the platform transparently handles any scaling of
the dip units needed, based on the actual density of the screen in use. The
conversion of dip units to screen pixels is simple: <code>pixels = dips *
(density / 160)</code>. For example, on 240 dpi screen, 1 dip would equal 1.5
physical pixels. Using dip units to define your application's UI is highly
recommended, as a way of ensuring proper display of your UI on different
screens. </p></dd>
</dl>


<h3 id="range">Range of Screens Supported</h3>

<p>Android 1.5 and earlier versions of the platform were designed to support a
single screen configuration &mdash; HVGA (320x480) resolution on a 3.2" screen.
Because the platform targeted just one screen, application developers could
write their applications specifically for that screen, without needing to worry
about how their applications would be displayed on other screens. </p>

<p>Starting from Android 1.6, the platform adds support for multiple screen
sizes and resolutions, reflecting the many new types and sizes of devices on
which the platform will run. This means that developers must design their
applications for proper display on a range of devices and screens.</p>

<p>To simplify the way application developers design their user interfaces for
multiple devices, and to allow more devices to participate without impacting
applications, the platform divides the range of actual supported screen sizes
and resolutions into:</p>

<ul>
<li>A set of three generalized sizes: <em>large</em>, <em>normal</em>, and <em>small</em>, and </li>
<li>A set of three generalized densities: high (<em>hdpi</em>), medium (<em>mdpi</em>), and low (<em>ldpi</em>)
</ul>

<!--<p>Applications use to these generalized sizesThe to let you apply custom UI
and enable/disable functionality according to the generalized class of screen,
rather than by the specific screen. When you are developing your application,
you use these generalized sizes and densities and  Applications can use these
generalized sizes and densities to tell the platform I will do it or you do it.
Or a combination of both. -->

<p>Applications can provide custom resources (primarily layouts) for any of the
three generalized sizes, if needed, and they can also provide resources
(primarily drawables such as images) for any of the three generalized densities.
Applications do not need to work with the actual physical size or density of the
device screen. At run time, the platform handles the loading of the correct size
or density resources, based on the generalized size or density of the current
device screen, and adapts them to the actual pixel map of the screen.</p>

<p>The range of screens supported by Android and the generalized screen
configurations that the platform maps them to are shown in the table below. </p>

<p class="caption" style="margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1.5em;"><strong>Table
1.</strong> Summary of device screens supported by Android. </p>

<p>As shown above, the various screen configurations are arranged around a
baseline screen &mdash; HVGA (320x480) resolution on a 3.2" screen &mdash; which
is assigned a size of "normal" and a density of "medium". The HVGA screen is
used as the baseline because all applications written against Android 1.5 or
earlier are (by definition) written for the HVGA screen used on the T-Mobile G1
and similar devices.</p>

<!-- <p>Note that each screen configuration spans a range of actual resolutions
and physical screen sizes. For example, the The baseline configuration spans a
range of actual screen sizes &mdash; from 3.0" to 3.5" diagonal &mdash; all with
the same HVGA resolution. That means that the actual pixel density of devices in
a single screen configuration can vary. </p>

Because differences in density can affect the displayed size of UI elements
declared in pixels, the framework provides a density-independent pixel (dip)
unit that applications can use to declare UI dimensions, letting the platform
automatically handle the scaling to the actual pixel density of the screen. When
UI dimensions are declared in dip, the result is that they are displayed at the
same physical size on all screens in a given configuration. </p> -->

<p>Although the platform currently supports the nine possible size-density
configurations listed in the table, you do not necessarily need to custom
resources for each one of them. The platform provides robust compatibility
features, described in the sections below, that can handle most of the work of
rendering your application on the current device screen, provided that the UI is
properly implemented. For more information, see  <a
href="#screen-independence">Best Practices for Screen Independence</a>.</p>


<h3 id="support">How Android supports multiple screens</h3>

<div class="sidebox-wrapper">
<div class="sidebox">
<h2>Using the alternate resources framework</h2>

<p>The platform's support for loading screen size- and density-specific
resources at run time is based on the alternate resources framework.

<p> If you want to use size- or density-specific layouts or drawables in your
application and you are not familiar with resource qualifiers or how the
platform uses them, please read 
<a href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/resources/resources-i18n.html#AlternateResources">
Alternate Resources</a>.
</div>
</div>

<p>The foundation of Android's support for multiple screens is a set of built-in
compatibility features that together manage the rendering of application
resources in an appropriate way for the current device screen. The platform
handles most of the work of rendering your application, but also gives you two
key ways to control the way your application is displayed, if you need or want
to use them:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The platform provides a set of resource qualifiers that let you provide
size- and density-specific resources, if needed. The qualifiers for 
size-specific resources are <code>large</code>, <code>normal</code>, and
<code>small</code>, and those for density-specific resources are
<code>hdpi</code> (high), <code>mdpi</code> (medium), and <code>ldpi</code>
(low). The qualifiers correspond to the generalized densities given in 
<a href="#range">Table 1</a>, above.</li>
  <li>The platform also provides a 
<a href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/manifest/supports-screens-element.html">
<code>&lt;supports-screens&gt;</code></a>
element, whose attributes
<code>android:largeScreens</code>, <code>android:normalScreens</code>, and
<code>android:smallScreens</code> let you specify what generalized screen sizes
your application supports. A fourth attribute, <code>android:anyDensity</code>,
lets you indicate whether or not your application includes built-in support for
multiple densities.</li>
</ul>

<p>At run time, the platform provides three types of support to your
application, to ensure the best possible display on the current device
screen:</p>

<ol>
<li><em>Pre-scaling of resources (such as image assets)</em> 

  <p>Based on the density of the current screen, the platform automatically
loads any size- or density-specific resources from your application and displays
them without scaling. If no matching resources are available, the platform loads
the default resources and scales them up or down as needed to match the current
screen's generalized density. The platform assumes that default resources are
designed for proper display at the baseline screen density of "medium" (160),
unless they are loaded from a density-specific resource directory.</p>

  <p>For example, if the current screen's density is "high", the platform loads
resources that are tagged with the qualifier <code>hdpi</code> and uses them
without scaling. If no such resources are available, the platform uses the
default resources instead, scaling them from the baseline density ("medium") to
"high".  </p>

  <p>For more information about how to create size- and density-specific
resources, see <a href="#qualifiers">Resource qualifiers</a>.</p></li>

<li><em>Auto-scaling of pixel dimensions and coordinates</em>

  <p>If the application states that it does not support different screen
densities, the platform auto-scales any absolute pixel coordinates, pixel
dimension values, and pixel math used in the application (such as might be used
for specifying the width or padding for a view). It does this to ensure that
pixel-defined screen elements are displayed at approximately the same physical
size as they would be at the baseline density of "medium" (160). The platform
handles this scaling transparently to the application and also reports scaled
overall pixel dimensions to the application, rather than physical pixel
dimensions. </p>

  <p>For instance, suppose a given device is using a WVGA high-denisty screen,
which is 480x800 and about the same size as a traditional HVGA screen, but it's
running an app that states that it does not support multiple densities. In this
case, the system will "lie" to the application when it queries for screen
dimensions, and report 320x533. Then, when the app does drawing operations, such
as invalidating the rectangle from (10,10) to (100, 100), the system will
likewise automatically transform the coordinates by scaling them the appropriate
amount, and actually invalidate the region (15,15) to (150, 150).  The same
thing happens in the other direction, if the application is running on a
lower-density screen, coordinates are scaled down.<p>

  <p>For more information, see the <code>android:anyDensity</code> attribute in
<a href="#attrs">Manifest attributes for screens support</a>.</p></li>

<div class="sidebox-wrapper" xstyle="margin-bottom:2em;margin-top:.5em;width:90%;"> 
  <img id="rule" src="{@docRoot}assets/images/grad-rule-qv.png"> 
  <div id="qv-sub-rule"> 
    <img src="{@docRoot}assets/images/icon_market.jpg" style="float:left;margin:0;padding:0;"> 
    <p style="color:#669999;">Publishing to Small Screen Devices</p> 
    <p>To ensure the best experience for users on small-screen devices, Android
Market only shows applications that explicitly declare support for small
screens. If you developed an application on Android 1.5 or earlier and published
it on Android Market, you need to <a href="#testing">test your application</a>
on small screens and then upload an updated version that explicitly 
<a href="#attrs">indicates support for small screens</a>. </p>
  </div> 
</div>

<li><em>Compatibility-mode display on larger screen-sizes</em>

  <p>If the current screen's size is larger than your application supports, as
specified in the <code>supports-screens</code> element, the platform displays
the application at the baseline size ("normal") and density ("medium). For
screens larger than baseline, the platform displays the application in a
baseline-sized portion of the overall screen, against a black background. </p>

  <p>For instance, suppose a given device is using a WVGA medium density screen,
classified as a "large" screen, but the application states that it does not
support large screens; in this case, the system will again "lie" to the
application when it queries for screen dimensions, and report 320x480.  Instead
of scaling the application, however, the application's 320x480 interface will be
placed as a "postage stamp" in the larger 480x800 screen.</p>

  <p>For more information, see the <code>android:anyDensity</code> attribute in
<a href="#attrs">Manifest elements for screens support</a> and the 
<a href="#compatibility-examples">Screen-Compatibility Examples</a>
section.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>In general, these compatibility features ensure that all applications,
including those written against Android 1.5 and earlier platform versions, can
display properly on most devices, especially when the device's screen is at the
baseline "normal" size or larger. </p>

<p>However, note that applications written for the baseline HVGA screen may need
minor adjustments before they display properly on smaller screens such as QVGA.
With the reduced screen area of small screens, there may be tradeoffs in design,
content, and function that you, as the application developer, need to consider.
For more information about how to prepare an existing application for display on
small screens, see <a href="#strategies">Strategies for Legacy
Applications</a>.</p>

<p>The sections below provide more information how to take advantage of the
platform's multiple-screens support. </p>


<h3 id="density-independence">Density independence</h3>

<p>The goal of density independence is to preserve the physical size, from the
user's point of view, of user interface elements declared in an application,
when the application is displayed on screens with different densities. Density
independence applies to both layouts and drawables such as icons. Maintaining
density-independence is important because, other things being equal, a UI
element (such as a button) whose height and width are defined in terms of screen
pixels will appear physically larger on the lower density screen and smaller on
the higher density screen. Such density-related size changes can cause problems
in application layout, usability, and consistency with other applications
installed on the device.</p>

<p>The platform provides density independence to applications by default. It
does this in three ways: </p>

<ul>
<li>Through pre-scaling of drawable resources (scaled at resource loading
time)</li>
<li>Through auto-scaling of device-independent pixel (dip) values used in
layouts</li>
<li>Through auto-scaling of absolute pixel values used in the application (only
needed if the application has set <code>android:anyDensity="false"</code> in its
manifest)</li>
</ul>

<p>The example screens below illustrate the density independence provided by the
platform. Note that both the layouts and launcher icons are displayed at the
same physical sizes, although screen sizes, aspect ratios, and densities are
different.</p>


<div id=vi09 style=TEXT-ALIGN:left>
<img src="{@docRoot}images/screens_support/dip.png" style="padding-bottom:0;margin-bottom:0;" />
<p class="caption" style="margin:0 0 1.5em 1em;padding:0 0 0
1em;"><strong>Figure 1.</strong> Examples of density independence on WVGA high
density (left), HVGA medium density (center), and QVGA low density (right). </p>
</div>

<p>In most cases, you can take advantage of density independence in your
application simply by making sure that your layouts specify all dimension values
in density-independent pixels (<code>dip</code> or <code>dp</code>) or
scale-independent pixels (<code>sip</code> or <code>sp</code>, for text only).
If you are using absolute pixel values in the application and manifest includes
<a href="#attrs"><code>android:anyDensity="true"</code></a>, you will also need
to scale the pixel values. See <a href="#dips-pels">Converting from dips to
pixels</a> for more information. </p> 


<h3 id="attrs">Manifest attributes for screens support</h3>

<p> Android 1.6 introduces a new manifest element, 
<a href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/manifest/supports-screens-element.html"><code>&lt;supports-screens&gt;</code></a>,
whose attributes you can use to control the
display of your application on different classes of device screens, as listed
below. The <code>smallScreens</code>, <code>normalScreens</code>, and
<code>largeScreens</code> attributes correspond to the generalized screen sizes
shown in <a href="#range">Table 1</a>, earlier in this document.</p>

    <table id="vrr8">

in different density environments &mdash; "<code>true</code>" if so, and
"<code>false</code>" if not. </p>
        <ul>
          <li>If set to "<code>true</code>", the platform disables its
density-compatibility features for all screen densities &mdash; specifically,
the auto-scaling of absolute pixel units and math &mdash; and relies on the
application to use density-independent pixel units and/or to manage the
adaptation of pixel values according to density of the current screen. </li>

          <li>If set to "<code>false</code>", the platform enables its
density-compatibility features for all screen densities. In this case, the
platform provides a scaled, virtual screen pixel map to the application, against
which it can layout and draw its UI as though against a medium-density screen
(160). The platform then transparently auto-scales the application's pixel units
and math as needed to match the actual device screen density. </li>
        </ul>

information about the assumed value of this attribute, if not declared.</p>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

<p>In general, when you declare a screen-size attribute
(<code>smallScreens</code>, <code>normalScreens</code>, or
<code>largeScreens</code>) as "true", you are signaling to the platform that
your application wants to manage its UI by itself, for all screen sizes, without
the platform applying any size-compatibility behaviors (such as a virtual HVGA
display area). If you declare a screen-size attribute as "false", you are
signaling that your application is not designed for that screen size. The
effects are conditioned by the screen size that your application does not
support:</p>
	
<ul>
    <li>If you declare <code>largeScreens="false"</code>, your application can
still be installed by users of devices with large screens. When run on a device
with a large screen, this attribute value causes the platform to run the
application in compatibility mode, rendering it in a baseline HVGA screen area
(normal size, medium density) reserved on the larger screen. See 
<a href="#compatibility-examples">Screen-Compatibility Examples</a> for an
illustration of what an application looks like when displayed in compatibility
mode.</li>
    <li>If you declare <code>smallScreens="false"</code>, your application can
still be installed by users of devices with small screens. However, this
attribute value causes Android Market to filter your application from the list
of applications available to such users. In effect, this prevents users from
installing the application on small-screen devices. </li>
</ul>

<p>If you declare the <code>android:anyDensity</code> attribute as "true", you
are signaling to the platform that your application wants to manage its UI by
itself, for all screen densities, using the actual screen dimensions and pixels.
In this case, the application must ensure that it declares its UI dimensions
using device-independent pixels and scales any actual pixel values or math by
the scaling factor available from 
{@link android.util.DisplayMetrics#density android.util.DisplayMetrics.density}.</p>

<p>Note that the setting of the <code>android:anyDensity</code> attribute does
not affect the platform's pre-scaling of drawable resources, such as bitmaps and
nine-patch images, which always takes place by default. </p>

<p>The following example shows a manifest that declares support for large,
normal, and small screens in any densities.</p>

<pre>&lt;manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"&gt;

  &lt;supports-screens
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; android:largeScreens="true"
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; android:normalScreens="true"
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; android:smallScreens="true"
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; android:resizable="true"
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; android:anyDensity="true" /&gt;
  &lt;/manifest&gt;
</pre>

<h4 id="defaults">
  Default values for attributes
</h4>

<p>The default values for the <code>&lt;supports-screens&gt;</code> attributes
differs, depending on the the value of the 
<a href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element.html"><code>android:minSdkVersion</code></a>
 attribute in the application's manifest, as well as on
the value of <code>android:targetSdkVersion</code>, if declared:</p>

<div>
  <ul>
    <li>
      If <code>android:minSdkVersion</code> or
<code>android:targetSdkVersion</code> is "3" (Android 1.5) or lower, the default
value for everything except android:normalScreens is <code>false</code>. If you
are primarily targeting pre-Android 1.6 platforms but also want to support other
densities/screen sizes, you need to set the appropriate attributes to
<code>true</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
      If <code>android:minSdkVersion</code> or
<code>android:targetSdkVersion</code> is "4" (Android 1.6) or higher, the
default value for everything is <code>true</code>. If your application
requires&nbsp;<span style=BACKGROUND-COLOR:#ffffff>Android 1.6 </span>features,
but does not support these densities and/or screen sizes, you need to set the
appropriate attributes to <code>false</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Note that <code>android:normalScreens</code> always defaults to
<code>true</code>.
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>


<h3 id="qualifiers">Resource directory qualifiers for screen size and density</h3>

<p>Android 1.6 supports new resource directory qualifiers for selecting
resources based on the characteristics of the screen on which your application
is running. You can use these qualifiers to provide size- and density-specific
resources in your application. For more information about the generalized sizes
and densities that correspond to the qualifiers, see <a href="#range">Table
1</a>, earlier in this document.</p>

<table>
<tr>
<th>Screen characteristic</th>
<th>Qualifier</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td rowspan="3">Size</td>
  <td><code>small</code></td>
  <td>Resources for small screens, such as QVGA low density.</td>

  <td><code>normal</code></td>
  <td>Resources for normal (baseline configuration) screens, such as T-Mobile
G1/HTC Magic screen size, or equivalent.</td>

platform versions. If your application is designed to run on both Android 1.5
(or lower) and Android 1.6 (and higher), you can use this qualifier to tag
resources that should be excluded when your application is running on Android
1.5 or earlier. Using this qualifier is necessary in some cases, if the older
platform is inadvertently loading resources from an Android 1.6 resources
directory. </td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
Note that the density and the screen size are independent parameters and are
interpreted by the system individually. For example, WVGA high density is
considered a normal screen because its physical size is about the same as one of
T-Mobile G1. On the other hand, a WVGA medium density screen is considered a 
<i>large</i> screen &mdash; it offers the same resolution but at lower pixel
density, meaning that it is both physically larger than the baseline screen and
can display significantly more information than a normal screen size.
</p>

<p>Here is an example of the resource directory structure of an application that
supports low and high density, and employs different layout schemes.</p>

<pre>res/layout/my_layout.xml            // layout for normal screen size
res/layout-small/my_layout.xml      // layout for small screen size
res/layout-large/my_layout.xml      // layout for large screen size
res/layout-large-land/my_layout.xml // layout for large screen size in landscape mode

res/drawable-ldpi/my_icon.png       // icon image for low density
res/drawable-mdpi/dpi/my_icon.png   // icon for medium density
res/drawable-hdpi/my_icon.png       // icon image for high density

res/drawable-nodpi/composite.xml    // density independent resource
</pre>

<h2 id="screen-independence">Best practices for Screen Independence</h2>

<p>The objective of supporting multiple screens is to create an application that
can run properly on any display and function properly on any of the screen
configurations listed in <a href="#range">Table 1</a> earlier in this document.
</p>

<p>You can easily ensure that your application will display properly on
different screens. Here is a quick checklist:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Prefer wrap_content, fill_parent and the dip unit to px in XML layout files
  </li>
  <li>
    Avoid AbsoluteLayout
  </li>
  <li>
    Do not use hard coded pixel values in your code
  </li>
  <li>
    Use density and/or resolution specific resources
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="use-relative">1. Prefer wrap_content, fill_parent and the dip unit to
absolute pixels<br> </h3>

<p>When defining the <code>layout_width</code> and <code>layout_height</code> of
views in an XML layout file, using <code>wrap_content</code>,
<code>fill_parent</code> or the <code>dip</code> will guarantee that the view is
given an appropriate size on the current device screen. For instance, a view
with a <code>layout_width="100dip"</code> will measure 100 pixels wide on an
HVGA@160 density display and 150 pixels on a WVGA@240 density display, but the
view will occupy approximately the same physical space. </p>

<p>Similarly, you should prefer the <code>sp</code> (scale-independent pixel,
the scale factor depends on a user setting) or <code>dip</code> (if you don't
want to allow the user to scale the text) to define font sizes.</p>

<h3 id="avoid-absolute">2. Avoid AbsoluteLayout </h3>

<p>{@link android.widget.AbsoluteLayout AbsoluteLayout}
is one of the layout containers offered by the Android UI toolkit. Unlike the
other layouts however, <code>AbsoluteLayout</code> enforces the use of fixed
positions which might easily lead to user interfaces that do not work well on
different displays. Because of this, <code>AbsoluteLayout</code> was deprecated
in Android 1.5 (API Level 3). </p>

<p>You can achieve much the same layout by using a 
{@link android.widget.FrameLayout FrameLayout} instead, and setting
<code>layout_margin</code> attributes of the children. This approach is more
flexible and will yield better results on different screens.</p>

<h3>3. Do not use hard-coded pixel values in your code</h3>

<p>For performance reasons and to keep the code simpler, the Android framework
API uses pixels as the standard unit for expressing dimension or coordinate
values. That means that the dimensions of a View are always expressed in the
code in pixels. For instance, if <code>myView.getWidth()</code> returns 10, the
view is 10 pixels wide. In some cases, you may need to scale the pixel values
that you use in your code. The sections below provide more information. </p>

<h4 id="dips-pels">Converting from dips to pixels</h4>

<p>In some cases, you will need to express dimensions in <code>dip</code> and
then convert them to pixels. Imagine an application in which a scroll gesture is
recognized after the user's finger has moved by at least 16 pixels. On a
baseline HVGA screen, the user will have to move his finger by 16 pixels / 160
dpi = 1/10th of an inch (or 2.5 mm) before the gesture is recognized. On a
device with a high (240) density display, the user will move his finger by only
16 pixels / 240 dpi = 1/15th of an inch (or 1.7 mm.) The distance is much
shorter and the application thus appears more sensitive to the user. To fix this
issue, the gesture threshold must be expressed in the code in <code>dip</code>
and then converted to actual pixels.</p>

<pre>// The gesture threshold expressed in dip
private static final float GESTURE_THRESHOLD_DIP = 16.0f;

// Convert the dips to pixels
final float scale = getContext().getResources().getDisplayMetrics().density;
mGestureThreshold = (int) (GESTURE_THRESHOLD_DIP * scale + 0.5f);</span>

// Use mGestureThreshold as a distance in pixels
</pre>

<p>The {@link android.util.DisplayMetrics#density android.util.DisplayMetrics.density} 
field specifies the the scale factor you must use to
convert dips to pixels according to the current screen density. You can access
the current screen's metrics through a <code>Context</code> or
<code>Activity</code>. On a medium (160) density screen,
<code>DisplayMetrics.density</code> equals "1.0", whereas on a high (240)
density screen it equals "1.5". You can refer to the documentation of the 
{@link android.util.DisplayMetrics DisplayMetrics}
class for details.</p>

<h4>Use pre-scaled configuration values</h4>

<p>The {@link android.view.ViewConfiguration ViewConfiguration} class can be
used to access the most common distances, speeds, and times used in the Android
framework. For instance, the distance in pixels used by the framework as the
scroll threshold can be obtained as follows:</p>

<pre>ViewConfiguration.get(aContext).getScaledTouchSlop()</pre>

<p>Methods starting with the <code>getScaled</code> prefix are guaranteed to return a value in pixels that will display properly regardless of the current screen density.</p>

<h3>4. Use density and/or size-specific resources</h3>

<div style="float: right;background-color:#fff;margin: 0;padding: 20px 0 20px 20px;">
<img src="{@docRoot}images/screens_support/scale-test.png" style="padding:0;margin:0;">
<p class="caption" style="margin:0;padding:0;"><strong>Figure 2.</strong> Comparison of pre-scaled and auto-scaled bitmaps.</p>
</div>

<p>Even with the size- and density-compatibility features that the platform
provides, you may still want to make adjustments to the UI of your application
when it displayed on certain screen sizes or densities. You can do this by
providing size- or density-specific resources &mdash; assets, layouts, strings,
and so on. If you want, you can also take control over the scaling of images
assets. The sections below provide more information.</p>

<h4 id="resource-dirs">Custom resources and directories</h4>

<p>If you need to control exactly how your application will look on various
displays, simply adjust your assets and layouts in configuration-specific
resources directories. For example, consider an icon that you want to display on
medium and high density screens. Simply create your icon at two different sizes
(for instance 100x100 for medium density and 150x150 for high density) and put
the two variations in the appropriate directories, using the proper
qualifiers:</p>

<p style="margin-left:2em;"><code>res/drawable-mdpi/icon.png&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//
for medium-density screens</code></p>

<p style="margin-left:2em;"><code>res/drawable-hdpi/icon.png&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//
for high-density screens</code></p>

<p>If a density qualifier is not defined in a resource directory name, the
platform assumes that the resources in that directory are designed for the
baseline medium density. It is not recommended that you put density-specific
resources such as images in the default directory.</p>

<p>For more information about valid resource qualifiers, see 
<a href="#qualifiers">Resource directory qualifiers</a>, earlier in this
document.</p>

<h4 id="scaling">Pre-scaling and auto-scaling of bitmaps and nine-patches</h4>

<p>When a bitmap or nine-patch image is loaded from the application's resources,
the platform attempts to pre-scale it to match the display's density. For
instance, if you placed a 100x100 icon in the <code>res/drawable/</code>
directory and loaded that icon as a bitmap on a high-density screen, Android
would automatically scale up the icon and produce a 150x150 bitmap.</p>

<p>This pre-scaling mechanism works independently of the source. For instance,
an application targeted for a high-density screen may have bitmaps only in the
<code>res/drawable-hdpi/</code> directory. If one of the bitmaps is a 240x240
icon and is loaded on a medium-density screen, the resulting bitmap will measure
160x160.</p>

<p>The platform pre-scales resources as needed, whether the application is
running with density-compatibility features enabled or not (as specified by the
value of <code>android:anyDensity</code>). However, when running with
density-compatibility enabled, the platform continues to report the size of
pre-scaled bitmaps and other resources as if they were loaded in a
medium-density environment. For example, when density-compatibility is enabled,
if you load a 76x76 image from the default resources for display on a
high-density screen, the platform will pre-scale the image to 114x114
internally. However, the API still reports the size of the image as 76x76. This
discrepancy may cause unexpected behavior if your application somehow directly
manipulates the scaled bitmap, but this was considered a reasonable trade-off to
keep the performance of existing applications as good as possible.</p>

<p>This does not apply for the case that an application creates an in-memory
bitmap internally and draws something on it, for later display on the screen.
The platform auto-scales such bitmaps on the fly, at draw time. Other side
effects of such a case might be that fonts drawn in such a bitmap will be scaled
at the bitmap level, when the off-screen bitmap is finally rendered to the
display, resulting in scaling artifacts.</p>

<p>There are situations in which you may not want Android to automatically scale
a resource. The easiest way to accomplish this is to put it in a "nodpi"
resource directory:</p>

<p style="margin-left:2em;"><code>res/drawable-nodpi/icon.png</code></p>

<p>You can also take complete control of the scaling mechanism by using the 
{@link android.graphics.BitmapFactory.Options BitmapFactory.Options} class,
which lets you define whether you want the bitmap to be pre-scaled and what the
density of the bitmap should be. For instance, if you are loading a bitmap from
a web server, you may want to force the bitmap's density to be high density.
When pre-scaling is disabled, the resulting bitmap is in auto-scaling mode. The
bitmap is associated with a density (that you may or may not have specified
through the <code>BitmapFactory.Options</code>) which will be used to scale the
bitmap on screen <em>at drawing time</em>. 

<p>Using auto-scaling instead of pre-scaling is more CPU expensive than
pre-scaling but uses less memory. You can refer to the documentation of 
{@link android.graphics.BitmapFactory BitmapFactory}, 
{@link android.graphics.Bitmap Bitmap}, and 
{@link android.graphics.Canvas Canvas} for more
information on auto-scaling.</p>

<p>Figure 2, at right, demonstrates the results of the pre-scale and auto-scale
mechanisms when loading low (120), medium (160) and high (240) density bitmaps
on a baseline screen. The differences are subtle, because all of the bitmaps are
being scaled to match the current screen density, however the scaled bitmaps
have slightly different appearances depending on whether they are pre-scaled or
auto-scaled at draw time.</p>

<h2 id="strategies">Strategies for Legacy Applications</h2>

<p>If you have already developed and published an Android application based on
Android 1.5 or earlier platform version, you need to consider how you will adapt
your application so that it is deployable to </p>

<ul>
<li>Existing devices, which may be running Android 1.5 (or lower) platform
version, as well as to </li>
<li>Newer devices that are running Android 1.6 (or higher) and offering various
screen sizes and resolutions</li>
</ul>

<p>To support the newer devices and the different screens they use, you might
need to make some changes in your app, but at the same time your app may be very
stable and so you want to minimize the changes. There are a variety of ways that
you can extend your existing application to support new devices with multiple
screens <em>and</em> existing devices running older platform versions. You
should be able to make these changes to your application such that you can
distribute a single .apk to any and all devices.</p>

<p>The recommended strategy is to develop against the most recent version of the
platform you are targeting, and test on the minimum one you want to run on.
Here's how to do that:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Maintain compatibility with existing devices by leaving your application's
<code>android:minSdkVersion</code> attribute as it is. You <em>do not</em> need
to increment the value of the attribute to support new devices and multiple
screens. </li>
  <li>Extend compatibility for Android 1.6 devices by adding a new attribute
&mdash; <code>android:targetSdkVersion</code> &mdash; to the
<code>uses-sdk</code> element. Set the value of the attribute to
"<code>4</code>". This allows your application to "inherit" the platform's
multiple screens support, even though it is technically using an earlier version
of the API. </li>
  <li>Add an empty <code>&lt;supports-screens&gt;</code> element as a child of
<code>&lt;manifest&gt;</code>. If you need to enable size or density attributes
later, this is where you will add them.</li>
  <li>Change your application's build properties, such that it compiles against
the Android 1.6 (API Level 4) library, rather than against the Android 1.5 (or
earlier) library. You will not be able to compile your application against the
older platform because of the new manifest attribute. </li>
  <li>Set up AVDs for testing your application on Android 1.6. Create AVDs that
use the screen sizes and densities that you want to support. When you create the
AVDs, make sure to select the Android 1.6 platform as the system image to run.
For more information, see <a href="#testing">How to Test Your Application on
Multiple Screens</a>, below.</li>
  <li>Set up AVDs for testing your application on Android 1.5 (or earlier
platform). You need AVDs running the older platforms you are targeting, so that
you can test for compatibility and ensure that there are no functional
regressions. </li>
  <li>Compile your application against the Android 1.6 library and run it on the
AVDs you created. Observe the way your application looks and runs, and test all
of the user interactions. </li>
  <li>Debug any display or functional issues. For issues that you resolve in
your application code, <span style="color:red">make certain not to use any APIs
introduced in API Level 4 or later</span>. If you are in doubt, refer to SDK
reference documentation and look for the API Level specifier for the API you
want to use. Using an API introduced in API Level 4 or later will mean that your
application will no longer be compatible with devices running Android 1.5 or
earlier.</li>
  <li>For resource-related issues, you can try resolving them by:
    <ul>
    <li>Adding a <code>anyDensity="false"</code> attribute to
<code>&lt;supports-screens&gt;</code>, to enable density-compatibility
scaling.</li>
    <li>Creating any size- or density-specific resources you need and placing
them in directories tagged with the <a href="#qualifiers">correct
qualifiers</a>. Qualifiers must be arranged in a proscribed order. See 
<a href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/resources/resources-i18n.html#AlternateResources">
Alternate Resources</a> for more information. </li>
    <li>Note that if you add size- or density-specific resource directories
tagged with any of the Android 1.6 qualifiers listed in this document, you
should make sure to also tag those directories with the <code>v4</code>
qualifier. This ensures that those resources will be ignored when the
application is run on Android 1.5 or lower platform versions.</p></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>If your application does not offer support (such as custom layouts) for
large screens and you want the platform to display your application in
screen-compatibility mode on larger screens, add a
<code>largeScreens="false"</code> attribute to the
<code>&lt;supports-screens&gt;</code> element in the manifest. See 
<a href="#compatibility-examples">Screen-Compatibility Examples</a> for
illustrations of how the platform displays your application in this case.</li>
  <li>If your application does not offer support (such as custom layouts) for
small screens (such as on a QVGA low-density screen) and you do not want Android
Market to offer the application to users of small-screen devices, you
<em>must</em> add a <code>smallScreens="false"</code> attribute to the
<code>&lt;supports-screens&gt;</code> element. </li>
  <li>Continue testing and debugging until your application performs as expected
on all of the platforms and screen sizes your application will support.</li>
  <li>Export, zipalign, and sign your application using the same private key you
used when publishing the previous version, then publish the application to users
as an update. </li>
</ol>

<p>In particular, remember to test your application on an AVD that emulates a
small-screen device. Devices that offer screens with QVGA resolution at low
density are available now. Users of those devices may want to download your
application, so you should understand how your application will look and
function on a small-screen device. In many cases, the reduced screen area and
density mean that you may need to make tradeoffs in design, content, and
function on those devices. </p>

<h2 id="testing">How to Test Your Application on Multiple Screens</h2>

<p>Before publishing an application that supports multiple screens, you should
thoroughly test it in all of the targeted screen sizes and densities. You can
test how it displays with the platform's compatibility features enabled or with
screen-specific UI resources included in your application. The Android SDK
includes all the tools you need to test your application on any supported
screen.</p>

<!-- You can test in any minsdk, and you can test with compatabiltiy code or
not. Once you've tested your application and found that it displays properly on
various screen sizes, you should make sure to add the corresponding size
attribute(s) to your application's manifest. -->

<p>As a test environment for your applications, set up a series of AVDs that
emulate the screen sizes and densities you want to support. The Android SDK
includes four emulator skins to get you started. You can use the Android AVD
Manager or the <code>android</code> tool to create AVDs that use the various
emulator skins and you can also set up custom AVDs to test densities other than
the defaults. For general information about working with AVDs, see 
<a href="{@docRoot}guide/developing/tools/avd.html">Android Virtual
Devices</a>.</p>

<p>The Android 1.6 SDK includes these emulator skins, which represent the
primary screen configurations that your should test:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    QVGA (240x320, low density, small screen)
  </li>
  <li>
    HVGA (320x480, medium density, normal screen)
  </li>
  <li>
    WVGA800 (480x800, high density, normal screen)
  </li>
  <li>
    WVGA854 (480x854 high density, normal screen)
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If you are using the <code>android</code> tool command line to create your
AVDs, here's an example of how to specify the skin you want to use:</p>

<pre>android create avd ... --skin WVGA800</pre>

<p>We also recommend that you test your application in an emulator that is set
up to run at a physical size that closely matches an actual device. This makes
it a lot easier to compare the results at various resolutions and densities. To
do so you will need to know the approximate density, in dpi, of your computer
monitor (a 30" Dell monitor has for instance a density of about 96 dpi.). Use
your monitor's dpi as the value of the <code>-scale</code> option, when
launching the emulator, for example:</p>

<pre>emulator -avd &lt;name&gt; -scale 96dpi</pre>

<p>If you are working in Eclipse with ADT, you can specify the <code>-scale
96dpi</code> option in the Target tab of run and debug configurations, under
"Additional Emulator Command Line Options" field. </p>

<p>Note that starting the emulator with the <code>-scale</code> option will
scale the entire emulator display, based on both the dpi of the skin and of your
monitor. Using the default densities, the emulator skins included in the Android
1.6 SDK will emulate the following screen sizes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    QVGA, low density: 3.3"
  </li>
  <li>
    HVGA, medium density: 3.6"
  </li>
  <li>
    WVGA800, high density: 3.9"
  </li>
  <li>
    WVGA854, high density: 4.1"
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You should also make sure to test your application on different physical
screen sizes within a single size-density configuration. For example, according
to <a href="#range">Table 1</a>, the minimum supported diagonal of QVGA is 2.8".
To display this is on a 30" monitor you will need to adjust the value passed to
<code>-scale</code> to 96*2.8/3.3 = 81dpi. You can also pass a float value to
<code>-scale</code> to specify your own scaling factor:</p>

<pre>emulator -avd &lt;name&gt; -scale 0.6</pre>

<p>If you would like to test your application on a screen not supported by the
built-in skins, you can either adjust an existing skin, or create a custom
resolution.</p>

<p>For example, to test on a large WVGA800 screen with medium density:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Create an AVD based on the WVGA800 skin (using the <code>android</code>
tool's command line.)<br></li>
  <li>Answer "yes" when asked about using custom hardware</li>
  <li>enter "160" when asked about the value for <em>hw.lcd.density</em>
(120-low, 160-medium, 240-high).</li>
</ol>

<p>When running this AVD, the emulator will emulate a 5.8" WVGA screen.</p>

<p>As an alternative to adjusting the emulator skin configuration, you can use
the emulator skin's default density and add the <code>-dpi-device</code> option
to the emulator command line when starting the AVD. For example, </p>

<pre>emulator -avd WVGA800 -scale 96dpi -dpi-device 160</pre>

<p>If you would like to test your application with a resolution not supported by
the provided skins, you can use the desired resolution in place of the skin
name. For instance, for FWQVGA you would use:</p>

<pre>android create avd ... --skin 240x432</pre>

<p>Next, you would need to set the proper density for the screen. When asked by
the tool whether you want to create a custom hardware profile for the new AVD,
enter "yes". Continue through the various profile settings until the tools asks
you to specify "Abstracted LCD density". Consult <a href="#range">Table 1</a>,
earlier in this document, and enter the appropriate value. For the FWQVGA
screen, the density should be "160", or medium.</p>

<h2 id="compatibility-examples">Screen-Compatibility Examples</h2>

<p>This section provides examples of how the Android platform displays an
application written for the baseline screen configuration &mdash; HVGA (320x480)
resolution on a 3.2" screen &mdash; with all of the platform's size- and
density-compatibility features enabled. That is, the examples show how 
the platform displays an application that doesn't provide built-in support 
for the screen on which it is being rendered, but which instead relies completely
on the platform.</p>

<p>The platform's screen-compatibility features are designed to provide such 
an application with a virtual baseline screen environment against which to run, 
while at the same time ensuring for the user a physical display that is 
approximately the same as the baseline screen size and density. </p>

<p>Legacy applications that have not been modified to support multiple
screens would be typical examples of such applications. In most cases, 
you would want to add multiple-screens support to a legacy application and
publish an updated version, as described in <a href="#strategies">Strategies
for Legacy Applications</a>. However, if you did not do so, the 
platform still performs best-effort rendering of your application, as
illustrated below.</p>

<p> Internally, these are the compatibility features that the platform
provides, based on the current device screen:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      If the device's screen density is <em>not medium</em>, the application's
layout and drawing of its content is as if the screen <em>is</em> medium density, but the
framework scales the layout and images (if the image for the target density is
not available) to fit the target density. It scales 1.5 times if the target
density is high density (160-&gt;240 virtual dpi), or 0.75 times if the target
density is low density (160 -&gt; 120 virtual dpi).
    </li>
    <li>
      If the device's screen size is <em>small</em>, there are few options
options for making Android 1.5 applications work well on such a screen, so 
Android Market will filter applications that are not known to support these
screens from the device. 
    </li>
    <li>
      If the device's screen size is <em>large</em>, it limits the application's
screen to the normal size and draws a black background around the application.
For example, if an application supports high density, but does not support large
screens, it only uses a 480x720 area of the screen and the rest will be filled
with a black background (see example below).
    </li>
  </ul>

<h3>Screen-compatibility limitations on small, low-density screens</h3>

<p>Because these device has smaller state/resolution, there are known
limitations when application runs in compatibility mode.</p>

<h4>QVGA</h4>

<p>Because QVGA (240x320) screens have less screen area available and lower
density than normal, which is 240x360 in low density, some applications cannot
render all their content properly on those screens.&nbsp; As a result, on a QVGA
device, Android Market will filter out all applications that do not declare they
support small screens.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<table style="width:10%;margin-left:.5em;">
  <tr>
    <td>The part of z value graph is chopped.</td>
    <td>The lap time area is chopped.<br></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img height=207 src="{@docRoot}images/screens_support/afdvfckr9j_16g95wjqg3_b.png" width="155"></td>
    <td><img height=186 src="{@docRoot}images/screens_support/afdvfckr9j_17p2w4txgc_b.png" width="139"></td>
  </tr>
</table>


<h4>Images with 1 pixel height/width.</h4>

<p>If an image has 1 pixel height or width, it may not be shown on the screen
due to rounding issue. This is inevitable as it just does not have enough
pixels.</p>

<p>For example, in the screen below, the divider in the menu is invisible
because the width of the image is trancated to 0. (This particular problem is
solvable because menu is handled inside framework, but there is no generic
solution as it just does not have enough pixels.)</p>
