      describe how activities work, illustrates them with examples, and
      describes important underlying principles and mechanisms, such as
      multitasking, activity reuse, intents, the activity stack, and 
      tasks. It covers this all from a high-level design perspective.

      that enable users to perform operations and navigate to other parts
      of your application or to other applications.  These guidelines describe

      menu items, when to put commands on-screen, and other details about
