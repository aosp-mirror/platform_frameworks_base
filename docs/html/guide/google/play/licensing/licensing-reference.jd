<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> As documented in <a
href="{@docRoot}guide/google/play/licensing/setting-up.html#test-env">
Setting Up The Testing Environment</a>, the response code can be manually
overridden for the application developer and any registered test users via the
Google Play publisher site.
<br/><br/>
Additionally, as noted above, applications that are in draft mode (in other
words, applications that have been uploaded but have <em>never</em> been
published) will return {@code LICENSED} for all users, even if not listed as a test
user. Since the application has never been offered for download, it is assumed
that any users running it must have obtained it from an authorized channel for
testing purposes.</p>




<h2 id="extras">Server Response Extras</h2>

<p>To assist your application in managing access to the application across the application refund
period and provide other information, The licensing server includes several pieces of
information in the license responses. Specifically, the service provides recommended values for the
application's license validity period, retry grace period, maximum allowable retry count, and other
settings. If your application uses <a href="{@docRoot}guide/google/play/expansion-files.html">APK
expansion files</a>, the response also includes the file names, sizes, and URLs. The server appends
the settings as key-value pairs in the license response "extras" field. </p>

<p>Any {@code Policy} implementation can extract the extras settings from the license
response and use them as needed. The LVL default {@code Policy} implementation, <a
href="{@docRoot}guide/google/play/licensing/adding-licensing.html#ServerManagedPolicy">{@code
ServerManagedPolicy}</a>, serves as a working
implementation and an illustration of how to obtain, store, and use the
settings. </p>

<h4 id="VT">License validity period</h4>

<p>The Google Play licensing server sets a license validity period for all
downloaded applications. The period expresses the interval of time over which an
application's license status should be considered as unchanging and cacheable by
a licensing {@code Policy} in the application. The licensing server includes the
validity period in its response to all license checks, appending an
end-of-validity timestamp to the response as an extra under the key {@code VT}. A
{@code Policy} can extract the VT key value and use it to conditionally allow access to
the application without rechecking the license, until the validity period
expires. </p>

<p>The license validity signals to a licensing {@code Policy} when it must recheck the
licensing status with the licensing server. It is <em>not</em> intended to imply
whether an application is actually licensed for use. That is, when an
application's license validity period expires, this does not mean that the
application is no longer licensed for use &mdash; rather, it indicates only that
the {@code Policy} must recheck the licensing status with the server. It follows that,
as long as the license validity period has not expired, it is acceptable for the
{@code Policy} to cache the initial license status locally and return the cached license
status instead of sending a new license check to the server.</p>

<p>The licensing server manages the validity period as a means of helping the
application properly enforce licensing across the refund period offered by
Google Play for paid applications. It sets the validity period based on
whether the application was purchased and, if so, how long ago. Specifically,
the server sets a validity period as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>For a paid application, the server sets the initial license validity period
so that the license response remains valid for as long as the application is
refundable. A licensing {@code Policy} in the application may cache the
result of the initial license check and does not need to recheck the license
until the validity period has expired.</li>
<li>When an application is no longer refundable, the server
sets a longer validity period &mdash; typically a number of days. </li>

<!-- TODO: Verify the following behavior is still true w/ OBB: -->
<li>For a free application, the server sets the validity period to a very high
value (<code>long.MAX_VALUE</code>). This ensures that, provided the {@code Policy} has
cached the validity timestamp locally, it will not need to recheck the
license status of the application in the future.</li>
</ul>

<p>The {@code ServerManagedPolicy} implementation uses the extracted timestamp
(<code>mValidityTimestamp</code>) as a primary condition for determining whether
to recheck the license status with the server before allowing the user access to
the application. </p>


<h4 id="GTGR">Retry period and maximum retry count</h4>

<p>In some cases, system or network conditions can prevent an application's
license check from reaching the licensing server, or prevent the server's
response from reaching the Google Play client application. For example, the
user might launch an application when there is no cell network or data
connection available&mdash;such as when on an airplane&mdash;or when the
network connection is unstable or the cell signal is weak. </p>

<p>When network problems prevent or interrupt a license check, the Google
Play client notifies the application by returning a {@code RETRY} response code to
the {@code Policy}'s <code>processServerResponse()</code> method. In the case of system
problems, such as when the application is unable to bind with Google Play's
{@code ILicensingService} implementation, the {@code LicenseChecker} library itself calls the
Policy <code>processServerResonse()</code> method with a {@code RETRY} response code.
</p>

<p>In general, the {@code RETRY} response code is a signal to the application that an
error has occurred that has prevented a license check from completing.

<p>The Google Play server helps an application to manage licensing under
error conditions by setting a retry "grace period" and a recommended maximum
retries count. The server includes these values in all license check responses,
appending them as extras under the keys {@code GT} and {@code GR}. </p>

<p>The application {@code Policy} can extract the {@code GT} and {@code GR} extras and use them to
conditionally allow access to the application, as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>For a license check that results in a {@code RETRY} response, the {@code Policy} should
cache the {@code RETRY} response code and increment a count of {@code RETRY} responses.</li>
<li>The {@code Policy} should allow the user to access the application, provided that
either the retry grace period is still active or the maximum retries count has
not been reached.</li>
</ul>

<p>The {@code ServerManagedPolicy} uses the server-supplied {@code GT} and {@code GR} values as
described above. The example below shows the conditional handling of the retry
responses in the <code>allow()</code> method. The count of {@code RETRY} responses is
maintained in the <code>processServerResponse()</code> method, not shown. </p>


<pre>    
public boolean allowAccess() {
    long ts = System.currentTimeMillis();
    if (mLastResponse == LicenseResponse.LICENSED) {
        // Check if the LICENSED response occurred within the validity timeout.
        if (ts &lt;= mValidityTimestamp) {
            // Cached LICENSED response is still valid.
            return true;
        }
    } else if (mLastResponse == LicenseResponse.RETRY &amp;&amp;
                ts &lt; mLastResponseTime + MILLIS_PER_MINUTE) {
        // Only allow access if we are within the retry period or we haven't used up our
        // max retries.
        return (ts &lt;= mRetryUntil || mRetryCount &lt;= mMaxRetries);
    }
    return false;
}</pre>
