<p>Publishing an application means testing it, packaging it appropriately, and making 
it available to users of Android-powered mobile devices for download or sideload.</p>

<p>If you've followed the steps outlined in 
<a href="{@docRoot}guide/publishing/preparing.html">Preparing to
Publish Your Applications</a>, the result of the process is a compiled .apk that
is signed with your release private key. Inside the .apk, the application is
properly versioned and any MapView elements reference a Maps API Key that you
obtained by registering the MD5 fingerprint of the same certificate used to sign
the .apk. Your application is now ready for publishing. </p>

<p>The sections below provide information about publishing your Android
application to mobile device users.</p>

<h2 id="overview">Publishing on Android Market</h2>

<p>Android Market is a hosted service that makes it easy for users to find and
download Android applications to their Android-powered devices, and makes it 
easy for developers to publish their applications to Android users.</p>

<p>To publish your application on Android Market, you first need to register
with the service using your Google account and agree to the terms of service.
Once you are registered, you can upload your application to the service whenever
you want, as many times as you want, and then publish it when you are ready.
Once published, users can see your application, download it, and rate it using
the Market application installed on their Android-powered devices. </p>

<p>To register as an Android Market developer and get started with publishing,
visit the Android Market: </p>

<p style="margin-left:3em;"><a
href="http://market.android.com/publish">http://market.android.com/publish</a>
</p>

<p>If you plan to publish your application on Android Market, you must make sure
that it meets the requirements listed below, which are enforced by the Market
server when you upload the application.</p>

<div class="special">
<p>Requirements enforced by the Android Market server:</p>
<ol>
<li>Your application must be signed with a cryptographic private key whose
validity period ends after <span style="color:red">22 October 2033</span>. </li>
<li>Your application must define both an <code>android:versionCode</code> and an
<code>android:versionName</code> attribute in the
<a
href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/manifest/manifest-element.html"><code>&lt;manifest&gt;</code></a>
element of its manifest. The server uses the <code>android:versionCode</code> as
the basis for identifying the application internally and handling updates, and
it displays the <code>android:versionName</code> to users as the application's
version.</li>
<li>Your application must define both an <code>android:icon</code> and an
<code>android:label</code> attribute in the <code>&lt;application&gt;</code>
element of its manifest.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<h3 id="marketupgrade">Publishing Updates on Android Market</h3>

<p>At any time after publishing an application on Android Market, you can upload
and publish an update to the same application package. When you publish an
update to an application, users who have already installed the
application will automatically receive a notification that an update is
available for the application. They can then choose to update the application
to the latest version.</p>

<p>Before uploading the updated application, be sure that you have incremented
the <code>android:versionCode</code> and <code>android:versionName</code>
attributes in the <a
href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/manifest/manifest-element.html"><code>&lt;manifest&gt;</code></a>
element of the manifest file. Also, the package name must be the same and the
.apk must be signed with the same private key. If the package name and signing
certificate do <em>not</em> match those of the existing version, Market will
consider it a new application and will not offer it to users as an update.</p>


<h3 id="marketLicensing">Using Android Market Licensing Service</h3>

<p>Android Market offers a licensing service that lets you enforce licensing
policies for paid applications that you publish through Android Market. With
Android Market Licensing, your applications can query Android Market at run time
to obtain their licensing status for the current user, then allow or disallow
further use as appropriate. Using the service, you can apply a flexible
licensing policy on an application-by-application basis &mdash; each 
application can enforce its licensing status in the way most appropriate
for it. </p>

<p>Any application that you publish through Android Market can use the Android
Market Licensing Service. The service uses no dedicated framework APIs, you can
add licensing to any legacy application that uses a minimum API level of 3 or
higher.</p>

<p>For complete information about Android Market Licensing Service and how to
use it in your application, see <a
href="{@docRoot}guide/publishing/licensing.html">Licensing Your
Applications</a>.</p>


<h3 id="marketintent">Using Intents to Launch the Market Application on 
a Device</h3>

<p>Android-powered devices include a preinstalled Market application that gives
users access to the Android Market site. From Market, users can
browse or search available applications, read ratings and reviews, and
download/install applications.</p>

<p>You can launch the Market application from another Android
application by sending an Intent to the system. You might want to do
this, for example, to help the user locate and download an update to an
installed application, or to let the user know about related
applications that are available for download. </p>

<p>To launch Market, you send an ACTION_VIEW Intent, passing a Market-handled
URI string as the Intent data. In most cases, your application would call
startActivity() to send the ACTION_VIEW Intent with the Market-handled URI.</p>

<p>The URI that you supply with the Intent lets the system route the intent
properly and also expresses the type of action that you want Market to perform
after launch. Currently, you can have Market take these actions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Initiate a search for applications on Android Market, based on the query
parameters that you provide, or </li>
<li>Load the Details page for a specific application on Android Market, based on
the application's package name.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Initiating a search</h4>

<p>Your application can initiate a search on Android Market for applications
that match the query parameters that you provide. To do so, your application
sends an ACTION_VIEW Intent that includes a URI and query parameters in this
format:</p>

<p style="margin-left:2em"><code>market://search?q=&lt;paramtype&gt;:&lt;value&gt;</code></p>

<div class="sidebox-wrapper" xstyle="margin-bottom:2em;margin-top:.5em;width:90%;"> 
  <img id="rule" src="{@docRoot}assets/images/grad-rule-qv.png"> 
  <div id="qv-sub-rule"> 
    <img src="{@docRoot}assets/images/icon_market.jpg" style="float:left;margin:0;padding:0;"> 
    <p style="color:#669999;">Searches on Android Market</p> 
<p>When you initiate a search, Android Market returns results from matches in
the public metadata supplied by developers in their Android Market profiles or
application publishing information, but not from the developer's private account
or from the certificate used to sign the application. </p>
  </div> 
</div>

<p>Using this URI format, you can search for applications by:</p>

<ul>
<li>Package name</li>
<li>Developer name</li>
<li>String match across application name, developer name, and
description, or </li>
<li>Any combination of the above</li>
</ul>

<p>The table at the bottom of this page specifies the <code>paramtypes</code>
and <code>values</code> that correspond to each of these types of search. </p>

<p>When you send an intent to initiate a search for applications, Market sends
the search query to the server and displays the result. To the user, the
experience is something like this: </p>

<ol>
<li>The user presses a link or button in your application.</li>
<li>The Market application launches and takes control of the screen, displaying
a progress indicator labeled "Searching" until it receives the search
results.</li>
<li>Market receives the search results and displays them. Depending on the query
parameters, the search results may include a list of one or more applications.
</li>
<li>From the results page, the user can select an app to go to its Details page,
which offers information about the app and lets the user download/purchase the
app.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Loading an application's Details page</h4>

<p>In Android Market, every application has a Details page that provides an
overview of the application for users. For example, the page includes a short
description of the app and screen shots of it in use, if supplied by the
developer, as well as feedback from users and information about the developer.
The Details page also includes an "Install" button that lets the user trigger
the download/purchase of the application.</p>

<p>If you want to refer the user to a specific appplication, your application
can take the user directly to the application's Details page. To do so, your
application sends an ACTION_VIEW Intent that includes a URI and query parameter
in this format:</p>

<p style="margin-left:2em"><code>market://details?id=&lt;packagename&gt;</code></p>

<p>In this case, the <code>packagename</code> parameter is target application's
fully qualified package name, as declared in the <code>package</code> attribute
of the <code>manifest</code> element in the application's manifest file. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-left:2em"><code>market://details?id=com.example.android.jetboy</code></p>

<h4>Android Market URIs</h4>

<p>The table below provides a list of URIs and actions currently
supported by the Market application.</p>

<p>Note that these URIs work only when passed as Intent data &mdash; you 
can't currently load the URIs in a web browser, either on a desktop machine or 
on the device. </p>
