<p>
Welcome to the <i>Android Dev Guide</i>! The Dev Guide is 
a practical introduction to developing applications for Android.  
It explores the concepts behind Android, the framework for 
constructing an application, and the tools for developing, 
testing, and publishing software for the platform.
</p>

<p>
The Dev Guide holds most of the documentation for the Android
platform, except for reference material on the framework API.  
For API specifications, go to the 
<a href="{@docRoot}reference/packages.html">Reference</a> tab above.
</p>  

<p>
As you can see in the panel on the left, the Dev Guide is 
divided into a handful of sections.  They are:
<p>

<dl>
<dt><b>Android Basics</b></dt>
<dd>An initial orientation to Android &mdash; what it is, 
what it offers, and how your application fits in.</dd>

<dt><b>Framework Topics</b></dt>
<dd>Discussions of particular parts of the Android framework
and API.  For an overview of the framework, begin with
<a href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/fundamentals.html">Application
Fundamentals</a>.  Then explore other topics &mdash; from 
designing a user interface and setting up resources to storing 
data and using permissions &mdash; as needed.</dd>

<dt><b>Developing</b></dt>
<dd>Directions for using Android's development and debugging tools, 
and for testing the results.</dd>

<dt><b>Publishing</b></dt>
<dd>Instructions on how to prepare your application for deployment
and how to publish it when it's ready.</dd>

<dt><b>Best Practices</b></dt> 
<dd>Recommendations on preferred techniques for writing  
applications that perform efficiently and work well for the
user.</dd>

<dt><b>Tutorials and Samples</b></dt> 
<dd>Step-by-step tutorials and sample code demonstrating how 
an Android application is constructed.</dd>

<dt><b>Appendix</b></dt>
<dd>Reference information and specifications, as well as FAQs, 
a glossary of terms, and other information.</dd>

<p>
The first step in programming for Android is downloading the SDK
(software development kit).  For instructions and information about
the kit, go to the <a href="{@docRoot}sdk/index.html">SDK</a> tab above.
</p>

<p>
After you have the SDK, begin by looking over the Dev Guide.
If you want to start by getting a quick look at the code, the short 
<a href="{@docRoot}guide/tutorials/hello-world.html">Hello World</a>
tutorial walks you through a standard "Hello, World" application as 
it would be written for the Android platform.  The 
<a href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/fundamentals.html">Application
Fundamentals</a> document is a good place to start for an 
understanding of the application framework.
</p>


<p>
For additional help, consider joining one or more of the Android 
discussion groups.  Go to the 
<a href="{@docRoot}community/index.html">Community</a> tab above 
for more information.
