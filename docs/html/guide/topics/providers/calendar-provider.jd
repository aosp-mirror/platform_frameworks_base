<p>The Calendar Provider is a repository for a user's calendar events. The
Calendar Provider API allows you to perform query, insert, update, and delete
operations on calendars, events, attendees, reminders, and so on.</p>


<p>The Calender Provider API can be used by applications and sync adapters. The
rules vary depending on what type of program is making the calls. This document
focuses primarily on using the Calendar Provider API as an application. For 
a discussion of how sync adapters are different, see 
<a href="#sync-adapter">Sync Adapters</a>.</p>


<p>Normally, to read or write calendar data, an application's manifest must
include the proper permissions, described in <a href="#manifest">User
Permissions</a>. To make performing common operations easier, the Calendar
Provider offers a set of intents, as described in <a href="#intents">Calendar
Intents</a>. These intents take users to the Calendar application to insert, view,
and edit events. The user interacts with the Calendar application and then
returns to the original application. Thus your application doesn't need to request permissions,
nor does it need to provide a user interface to view or create events.</p>

<h2 id="overview">Basics</h2>

<p><a href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/providers/content-providers.html">Content providers</a> store data and make it accessible to 
applications. The content providers offered by the Android platform (including the Calendar Provider) typically expose data as a set of tables based on a
relational database model, where each row is a record and each column is data of
a particular type and meaning. Through the Calendar Provider API, applications
and sync adapters can get read/write access to the database tables that hold a
user's calendar data.</p>

<p>Every content provider exposes a public URI (wrapped as a 
{@link android.net.Uri} 
object) that uniquely identifies its data set.  A content provider that controls
 multiple data sets (multiple tables) exposes a separate URI for each one.  All 
URIs for providers begin with the string &quot;content://&quot;.  This
identifies the data as being controlled by a content provider. The Calendar
Provider defines constants for the URIs for each of its classes (tables). These
URIs have the format <code><em>&lt;class&gt;</em>.CONTENT_URI</code>. For
example, {@link android.provider.CalendarContract.Events#CONTENT_URI Events.CONTENT_URI}.</p>

<p>Figure 1 shows a graphical representation of the Calendar Provider data model. It shows the
main tables and the fields that link them to each other.</p>

<img src="{@docRoot}images/providers/datamodel.png" alt="Calendar Provider Data Model"/>
<p class="img-caption"><strong>Figure 1.</strong> Calendar Provider data model.</p>

<p>A user can have multiple calendars, and different calendars can be associated with different types of accounts (Google Calendar, Exchange, and so on).</p>

<p>The {@link android.provider.CalendarContract} defines the data model of calendar and event related information. This data is stored in a number of tables, listed below.</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Table (Class)</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p>{@link android.provider.CalendarContract.Calendars}</p></td>
    
    <td>This table holds 
the calendar-specific information. Each  row in this table contains the details for
a single calendar, such as the  name, color, sync information, and so on.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>{@link android.provider.CalendarContract.Events}</td>
    
    <td>This table holds the
event-specific information. Each row  in this table has the information for a single
event&mdash;for example, event title, location, start time, end
time, and so on. The event can occur one-time or can recur multiple times. Attendees,
reminders, and extended  properties are stored in separate tables. 
They each have an {@link android.provider.CalendarContract.AttendeesColumns#EVENT_ID} 
that references the {@link android.provider.BaseColumns#_ID} in the Events table.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>{@link android.provider.CalendarContract.Instances}</td>
    
    <td>This table holds the
start and end time for each occurrence of an event. Each row in this table
represents a single event occurrence. For one-time events there is a 1:1 mapping
of instances to events. For recurring events, multiple rows are automatically
 generated that correspond to multiple occurrences of that event.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>{@link android.provider.CalendarContract.Attendees}</td>
    
    <td>This table holds the
event attendee (guest) information. Each row represents a single guest of an
event. It specifies the type of guest and the guest's attendance response
for the event.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>{@link android.provider.CalendarContract.Reminders}</td>
    
    <td>This table holds the
alert/notification data. Each row represents a single alert for an event. An
event can have multiple reminders. The maximum number of reminders per event is
specified in 
{@link android.provider.CalendarContract.CalendarColumns#MAX_REMINDERS}, 
which is set by the sync adapter that
owns  the given calendar. Reminders are specified in minutes before the event
and have a method that determines how the user will be alerted.</td>
  </tr>
  
</table>

<p>The Calendar Provider API is designed to be flexible and powerful. At the
same time, it's important to provide a good end user experience and
protect the integrity of the calendar and its data. To this end, here are
some things to keep in mind when using the API:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Inserting, updating, and viewing calendar events.</strong> To directly insert, modify, and read events from the Calendar Provider, you need the appropriate <a href="#manifest">permissions</a>. However, if you're not building a full-fledged calendar application or sync adapter, requesting these permissions isn't necessary. You can instead use intents supported by Android's Calendar application to hand off read and write operations to that application. When you use the intents, your application sends users to the Calendar application to perform the desired operation
in a pre-filled form. After they're done, they're returned to your application.
By designing your application to perform common operations through the Calendar,
you provide users with a consistent, robust user interface. This is the
recommended approach. For more information, see <a href="#intents">Calendar
Intents</a>.</p>


<li><strong>Sync adapters.</strong> A sync adapter synchronizes the calendar data
on a user's device with another server or data source. In the 
{@link android.provider.CalendarContract.Calendars} and
{@link android.provider.CalendarContract.Events} tables, 
there are columns that are reserved for the sync adapters to use.
The provider and applications should not modify them. In fact, they are not
visible unless they are accessed as a sync adapter. For more information about
sync adapters, see <a href="#sync-adapter">Sync Adapters</a>.</li>

</ul>


<h2 id="manifest">User Permissions</h2>

<p>To read calendar data, an application must include the {@link
android.Manifest.permission#READ_CALENDAR} permission in its manifest file. It
must include the {@link android.Manifest.permission#WRITE_CALENDAR} permission
to delete, insert or update calendar data:</p>

<pre>
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;manifest xmlns:android=&quot;http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android&quot;...&gt;
    &lt;uses-sdk android:minSdkVersion=&quot;14&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;uses-permission android:name=&quot;android.permission.READ_CALENDAR&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;uses-permission android:name=&quot;android.permission.WRITE_CALENDAR&quot; /&gt;
    ...
&lt;/manifest&gt;
</pre>


<h2 id="calendar">Calendars Table</h2>

<p>The {@link android.provider.CalendarContract.Calendars} table contains details 
for individual calendars. The following
Calendars columns are writable by both an application and a <a href="#sync-adapter">sync adapter</a>. 
For a full list of supported fields, see the
{@link android.provider.CalendarContract.Calendars} reference.</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Constant</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>{@link android.provider.CalendarContract.Calendars#NAME}</td>
    <td>The name of the calendar.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>{@link android.provider.CalendarContract.Calendars#CALENDAR_DISPLAY_NAME}</td>
    <td>The name of this calendar that is displayed to the user.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>{@link android.provider.CalendarContract.Calendars#VISIBLE}</td>
    
    <td>A boolean indicating whether the calendar is selected to be displayed. A
value of 0 indicates that events associated with this calendar should not be
shown.  A value of 1 indicates that events associated with this calendar should
be shown. This value affects the generation of rows in the {@link
android.provider.CalendarContract.Instances} table.</td>


  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>{@link android.provider.CalendarContract.CalendarColumns#SYNC_EVENTS}</td>
    
    <td>A boolean indicating whether the calendar should be synced and have its
events stored on the device. A value of 0 says do not sync this calendar or
store its events on the device.  A value of 1 says sync events for this calendar
and store its events on the device.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h3 id="query">Querying a calendar</h3>

<p>Here is an example that shows how to get the calendars that are owned by a particular
user. For simplicity's sake, in this example the query operation is shown in the
user interface thread ("main thread"). In practice, this should be done in an asynchronous
thread instead of on the main thread. For more discussion, see 
<a href="{@docRoot}guide/components/loaders.html">Loaders</a>. If you are not just 
reading data but modifying it, see {@link android.content.AsyncQueryHandler}.
</p>


<pre>
// Projection array. Creating indices for this array instead of doing
// dynamic lookups improves performance.
public static final String[] EVENT_PROJECTION = new String[] {
    Calendars._ID,                           // 0
    Calendars.ACCOUNT_NAME,                  // 1
    Calendars.CALENDAR_DISPLAY_NAME,         // 2
    Calendars.OWNER_ACCOUNT                  // 3
};
  
// The indices for the projection array above.
private static final int PROJECTION_ID_INDEX = 0;
private static final int PROJECTION_ACCOUNT_NAME_INDEX = 1;
private static final int PROJECTION_DISPLAY_NAME_INDEX = 2;
private static final int PROJECTION_OWNER_ACCOUNT_INDEX = 3;</pre>
  

<div class="sidebox-wrapper"> <div class="sidebox"> <h3>Why must you include
ACCOUNT_TYPE?</h3> <p>If you query on a {@link
android.provider.CalendarContract.Calendars#ACCOUNT_NAME
Calendars.ACCOUNT_NAME}, you must also include 
{@link android.provider.CalendarContract.Calendars#ACCOUNT_TYPE Calendars.ACCOUNT_TYPE}
in the selection. That is because a given account is
only considered unique given both its <code>ACCOUNT_NAME</code> and its
<code>ACCOUNT_TYPE</code>. The <code>ACCOUNT_TYPE</code> is the string corresponding to the
account authenticator that was used when the account was registered with the
{@link android.accounts.AccountManager}. There is also a special type of account called {@link
android.provider.CalendarContract#ACCOUNT_TYPE_LOCAL} for calendars not
associated with a device account. {@link
android.provider.CalendarContract#ACCOUNT_TYPE_LOCAL} accounts do not get
synced.</p> </div> </div> 


<p> In the next part of the example, you construct your query. The selection
specifies the criteria for the query. In this example the query is looking for
calendars that have the <code>ACCOUNT_NAME</code>
"sampleuser@google.com", the <code>ACCOUNT_TYPE</code>
"com.google", and the <code>OWNER_ACCOUNT</code>
"sampleuser@google.com". If you want to see all calendars that a user
has viewed, not just calendars the user owns, omit the <code>OWNER_ACCOUNT</code>.
The query returns a {@link android.database.Cursor}
object that you can use to traverse the result set returned by the database
query. For more discussion of using queries in content providers, 
see <a href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/providers/content-providers.html">Content Providers</a>.</p>


<pre>// Run query
Cursor cur = null;
ContentResolver cr = getContentResolver();
Uri uri = Calendars.CONTENT_URI;   
String selection = "((" + Calendars.ACCOUNT_NAME + " = ?) AND (" 
                        + Calendars.ACCOUNT_TYPE + " = ?) AND ("
                        + Calendars.OWNER_ACCOUNT + " = ?))";
String[] selectionArgs = new String[] {"sampleuser@gmail.com", "com.google",
        "sampleuser@gmail.com"}; 
// Submit the query and get a Cursor object back. 
cur = cr.query(uri, EVENT_PROJECTION, selection, selectionArgs, null);</pre>

<p>This next section uses the cursor to step through the result set. It uses the
constants that were set up at the beginning of the example to return the values
for each field.</p>
    
<pre>// Use the cursor to step through the returned records
while (cur.moveToNext()) {
    long calID = 0;
    String displayName = null;
    String accountName = null;
    String ownerName = null;
      
    // Get the field values
    calID = cur.getLong(PROJECTION_ID_INDEX);
    displayName = cur.getString(PROJECTION_DISPLAY_NAME_INDEX);
    accountName = cur.getString(PROJECTION_ACCOUNT_NAME_INDEX);
    ownerName = cur.getString(PROJECTION_OWNER_ACCOUNT_INDEX);
              
    // Do something with the values...

   ...
}
</pre>
  
<h3 id="modify-calendar">Modifying a calendar</h3>

<p>To perform an update of an calendar, you can provide the {@link
android.provider.BaseColumns#_ID} of the calendar either as an appended ID to
the Uri 

({@link android.content.ContentUris#withAppendedId(android.net.Uri,long) withAppendedId()}) 
or as the first selection item. The  selection
should start with <code>&quot;_id=?&quot;</code>, and the first
<code>selectionArg</code> should be  the {@link
android.provider.BaseColumns#_ID} of the calendar. 
You can also do updates by encoding the ID in the URI. This example changes a
calendar's display name using the 
({@link android.content.ContentUris#withAppendedId(android.net.Uri,long) withAppendedId()}) 
approach:</p>

<pre>private static final String DEBUG_TAG = "MyActivity";
...
long calID = 2;
ContentValues values = new ContentValues();
// The new display name for the calendar
values.put(Calendars.CALENDAR_DISPLAY_NAME, &quot;Trevor's Calendar&quot;);
Uri updateUri = ContentUris.withAppendedId(Calendars.CONTENT_URI, calID);
int rows = getContentResolver().update(updateUri, values, null, null);
Log.i(DEBUG_TAG, &quot;Rows updated: &quot; + rows);</pre>

<h3 id="insert-calendar">Inserting a calendar</h2>

<p>Calendars are  designed to be primarily managed by a sync adapter, so you
should only insert new calendars as a sync adapter. For the most part,
applications can only make superficial changes to calendars, such as changing the display name. If
an application needs to create a local calendar, it can do this by performing
the calendar insertion as a sync adapter, using an {@link
android.provider.CalendarContract.SyncColumns#ACCOUNT_TYPE} of {@link
android.provider.CalendarContract#ACCOUNT_TYPE_LOCAL}.
{@link android.provider.CalendarContract#ACCOUNT_TYPE_LOCAL} 
is a special account type for calendars that are not
associated with a device account. Calendars of this type are not synced to a server. For a
discussion of sync adapters, see <a href="#sync-adapter">Sync Adapters</a>.</p>

<h2 id="events">Events Table</h2>

<p>The {@link android.provider.CalendarContract.Events} table contains details
for individual events. To add, update, or delete  events, an application must
include the {@link android.Manifest.permission#WRITE_CALENDAR} permission in its
<a href="#manifest">manifest file</a>.</p>

<p>The following Events columns are writable by both an application and a sync
adapter. For a full list of supported fields, see the {@link
android.provider.CalendarContract.Events} reference.</p>

  <tr>
    <th>Constant</th>
    <th>Description</th>

should last one hour, and a value of <code>&quot;P2W&quot;</code> indicates a
duration of 2 weeks. </td>


  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>{@link android.provider.CalendarContract.EventsColumns#ALL_DAY}</td>
    
    <td>A value of 1 indicates this event occupies the entire day, as defined by

<h3 id="add-event">Adding Events</h3>

<p>When your application inserts a new event, we recommend that you use an
{@link android.content.Intent#ACTION_INSERT INSERT} Intent, as described in <a
href="#intent-insert">Using an intent to insert an event</a>. However, if you
need to, you can insert events directly. This section describes how to do
this.</p>


<p>Here are the rules for inserting a new event: </p>
<ul>

  <li>You must include  {@link
android.provider.CalendarContract.EventsColumns#CALENDAR_ID} and {@link
android.provider.CalendarContract.EventsColumns#DTSTART}.</li>

<li>You must include an {@link
android.provider.CalendarContract.EventsColumns#EVENT_TIMEZONE}. To get a list
of the system's installed time zone IDs, use {@link
java.util.TimeZone#getAvailableIDs()}. Note that this rule does not apply if
you're inserting an event through the {@link
android.content.Intent#ACTION_INSERT INSERT} Intent, described in <a
href="#intent-insert">Using an intent to insert an event</a>&mdash;in that
scenario, a default time zone is supplied.</li>
  
  <li>For non-recurring events, you must include {@link
android.provider.CalendarContract.EventsColumns#DTEND}. </li>
  
  
  <li>For recurring events, you must include a {@link
android.provider.CalendarContract.EventsColumns#DURATION} in addition to  {@link
android.provider.CalendarContract.EventsColumns#RRULE} or {@link
android.provider.CalendarContract.EventsColumns#RDATE}. Note that this rule does not apply if
you're inserting an event through the {@link
android.content.Intent#ACTION_INSERT INSERT} Intent, described in <a
href="#intent-insert">Using an intent to insert an event</a>&mdash;in that
scenario, you can use an {@link
android.provider.CalendarContract.EventsColumns#RRULE} in conjunction with {@link android.provider.CalendarContract.EventsColumns#DTSTART} and {@link android.provider.CalendarContract.EventsColumns#DTEND}, and the Calendar application 
converts it to a duration automatically.</li>
  
</ul>

<p>Here is an example of inserting an event. This is being performed in the UI
thread for simplicity. In practice, inserts and updates should be done in an
asynchronous thread to move the action into a background thread. For more
information, see {@link android.content.AsyncQueryHandler}.</p>


<pre>
long calID = 3;
long startMillis = 0; 
long endMillis = 0;     
Calendar beginTime = Calendar.getInstance();
beginTime.set(2012, 9, 14, 7, 30);
startMillis = beginTime.getTimeInMillis();
Calendar endTime = Calendar.getInstance();
endTime.set(2012, 9, 14, 8, 45);
endMillis = endTime.getTimeInMillis();
...

ContentResolver cr = getContentResolver();
ContentValues values = new ContentValues();
values.put(Events.DTSTART, startMillis);
values.put(Events.DTEND, endMillis);
values.put(Events.TITLE, &quot;Jazzercise&quot;);
values.put(Events.DESCRIPTION, &quot;Group workout&quot;);
values.put(Events.CALENDAR_ID, calID);
values.put(Events.EVENT_TIMEZONE, "America/Los_Angeles");
Uri uri = cr.insert(Events.CONTENT_URI, values);

// get the event ID that is the last element in the Uri
long eventID = Long.parseLong(uri.getLastPathSegment());
// 
// ... do something with event ID
//
//</pre>

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> See how this example captures the event
ID after the event is created. This is the easiest way to get an event ID. You often
need the event ID to perform other calendar operations&mdash;for example, to add
attendees or reminders to an event.</p>


<h3 id="update-event">Updating Events</h3>

<p>When your application wants to allow the user to edit an event, we recommend
that you use an {@link android.content.Intent#ACTION_EDIT EDIT} Intent, as
described in <a href="#intent-edit">Using an intent to edit an  event</a>.
However, if you need to, you can edit events directly. To perform an update of
an Event, you can provide the <code>_ID</code> of the 
event either as an appended ID to the Uri ({@link
android.content.ContentUris#withAppendedId(android.net.Uri,long) withAppendedId()}) 
or as the first selection item. 
The selection should start with <code>&quot;_id=?&quot;</code>, and the first
<code>selectionArg</code> should be  the <code>_ID</code> of the event. You can
also do updates using a selection with no ID. Here is an example of updating an
event. It changes the title of the event using the 
{@link android.content.ContentUris#withAppendedId(android.net.Uri,long) withAppendedId()}
approach:</p>


<pre>private static final String DEBUG_TAG = "MyActivity";
...
long eventID = 188;
...
ContentResolver cr = getContentResolver();
ContentValues values = new ContentValues();
Uri updateUri = null;
// The new title for the event
values.put(Events.TITLE, &quot;Kickboxing&quot;); 
updateUri = ContentUris.withAppendedId(Events.CONTENT_URI, eventID);
int rows = getContentResolver().update(updateUri, values, null, null);
Log.i(DEBUG_TAG, &quot;Rows updated: &quot; + rows);  </pre>

<h3 id="delete-event">Deleting Events</h3>

<p>You can delete an event either by its {@link
android.provider.BaseColumns#_ID} as an appended  ID on the URI, or by using
standard selection. If you use an appended ID, you can't also do a selection.
There are two versions of delete: as an application and as a sync adapter. An
application delete sets the <em>deleted</em> column to 1. This flag that tells
the sync adapter that the row was deleted and that this deletion should be
propagated to the server. A sync adapter delete removes the event from the
database along with all its associated data. Here is an example of application
deleting an event through its {@link android.provider.BaseColumns#_ID}:</p>


<pre>private static final String DEBUG_TAG = "MyActivity";
...
long eventID = 201;
...
ContentResolver cr = getContentResolver();
ContentValues values = new ContentValues();
Uri deleteUri = null;
deleteUri = ContentUris.withAppendedId(Events.CONTENT_URI, eventID);
int rows = getContentResolver().delete(deleteUri, null, null);
Log.i(DEBUG_TAG, &quot;Rows deleted: &quot; + rows);  
</pre>

<h2 id="attendees">Attendees Table</h2>

<p>Each row of the {@link android.provider.CalendarContract.Attendees} table
represents a single attendee or guest of an event. Calling 
{@link android.provider.CalendarContract.Reminders#query(android.content.ContentResolver, long, java.lang.String[]) query()} 
returns a list of attendees for  the
event with the given {@link android.provider.CalendarContract.AttendeesColumns#EVENT_ID}. 
This  {@link android.provider.CalendarContract.AttendeesColumns#EVENT_ID} 
must match the {@link
android.provider.BaseColumns#_ID} of a particular event.</p> 

<p>The following table lists the
writable fields. When inserting a new attendee, you must include all of them 
except <code>ATTENDEE_NAME</code>.
</p>

<h3 id="query-instances">Querying the Instances table</h3>

<p>To query the Instances table, you need to specify a range time for the query

implementation of the {@link android.provider.CalendarContract.EventsColumns} interface. 
In other words, {@link

</table> 
<p>The following sections describe how to use these intents.</p>


<h3 id="intent-insert">Using an intent to insert an event</h3>

<p>Using the {@link android.content.Intent#ACTION_INSERT INSERT} Intent
lets your application hand off the event insertion task to the Calendar itself.
With this approach, your application doesn't even need to have the {@link
android.Manifest.permission#WRITE_CALENDAR} permission included in its <a
href="#manifest">manifest file</a>.</p>

  
<p>When users run an application that uses this approach, the application sends
them to the Calendar to finish adding the event. The {@link
android.content.Intent#ACTION_INSERT INSERT} Intent uses extra fields to
pre-populate a form with the details of the event in the Calendar. Users can
then cancel the event, edit the form as needed, or save the event to their
calendars.</p>
  


<p>Here is a code snippet that schedules an event on January 19, 2012, that runs
from 7:30 a.m. to 8:30 a.m. Note the following about this code snippet:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It specifies {@link android.provider.CalendarContract.Events#CONTENT_URI Events.CONTENT_URI} 
  as the Uri.</li>
  
  <li>It uses the {@link
android.provider.CalendarContract#EXTRA_EVENT_BEGIN_TIME
CalendarContract.EXTRA_EVENT_BEGIN_TIME} and {@link
android.provider.CalendarContract#EXTRA_EVENT_END_TIME
CalendarContract.EXTRA_EVENT_END_TIME} extra fields to pre-populate the form
with the time of the event. The values  for these times must be in UTC milliseconds
from the epoch.</li>
  
  <li>It uses the {@link android.content.Intent#EXTRA_EMAIL Intent.EXTRA_EMAIL}
extra field to provide a comma-separated list of invitees, specified by email address.</li>
  
</ul>
<pre>
Calendar beginTime = Calendar.getInstance();
beginTime.set(2012, 0, 19, 7, 30);
Calendar endTime = Calendar.getInstance();
endTime.set(2012, 0, 19, 8, 30);
Intent intent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_INSERT)
        .setData(Events.CONTENT_URI)
        .putExtra(CalendarContract.EXTRA_EVENT_BEGIN_TIME, beginTime.getTimeInMillis())
        .putExtra(CalendarContract.EXTRA_EVENT_END_TIME, endTime.getTimeInMillis())
        .putExtra(Events.TITLE, &quot;Yoga&quot;)
        .putExtra(Events.DESCRIPTION, &quot;Group class&quot;)
        .putExtra(Events.EVENT_LOCATION, &quot;The gym&quot;)
        .putExtra(Events.AVAILABILITY, Events.AVAILABILITY_BUSY)
        .putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_EMAIL, &quot;rowan@example.com,trevor@example.com&quot;);
startActivity(intent);
</pre>

<h3 id="intent-edit">Using an intent to edit an event</h3>

<p>You can update an event directly, as described in <a
href="#update-event">Updating events</a>. But using the {@link
android.content.Intent#ACTION_EDIT EDIT} Intent allows an application that
doesn't have permission to hand off event editing to the Calendar application.
When users finish editing their event in Calendar, they're returned to the
original application.</p> <p>Here is an example of an intent that sets a new
title for a specified event and lets users edit the event in the Calendar.</p>


<pre>long eventID = 208;
Uri uri = ContentUris.withAppendedId(Events.CONTENT_URI, eventID);
Intent intent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_EDIT)
    .setData(uri)
    .putExtra(Events.TITLE, &quot;My New Title&quot;);
startActivity(intent);</pre>

<h3 id="intent-view">Using  intents to view calendar data</h3>
<p>Calender Provider offers two different ways to use the {@link android.content.Intent#ACTION_VIEW VIEW} Intent:</p>
<ul>
  <li>To open the Calendar to a particular date.</li>
  <li>To view an event.</li>

</ul>
<p>Here is an example that shows how to open the Calendar to a particular date:</p>
<pre>// A date-time specified in milliseconds since the epoch.
long startMillis;
...
Uri.Builder builder = CalendarContract.CONTENT_URI.buildUpon();
builder.appendPath(&quot;time&quot;);
ContentUris.appendId(builder, startMillis);
Intent intent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW)
    .setData(builder.build());
startActivity(intent);</pre>

<p>Here is an example that shows how to open an event for viewing:</p>
<pre>long eventID = 208;
...
Uri uri = ContentUris.withAppendedId(Events.CONTENT_URI, eventID);
Intent intent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW)
   .setData(uri);
startActivity(intent);
</pre>


<h2 id="sync-adapter">Sync Adapters</h2>


<p>There are only minor differences in how an application and a sync adapter
access the Calendar Provider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A sync adapter needs to specify that it's a sync adapter by setting {@link android.provider.CalendarContract#CALLER_IS_SYNCADAPTER} to <code>true</code>.</li>
  
  
  <li>A sync adapter needs to provide an {@link
android.provider.CalendarContract.SyncColumns#ACCOUNT_NAME} and an {@link
android.provider.CalendarContract.SyncColumns#ACCOUNT_TYPE} as query parameters in the URI. </li>
  
  <li>A sync adapter has write access to more columns than an application or widget.
  For example, an application can only modify a few characteristics of a calendar, 
  such as its name, display name, visibility setting, and whether the calendar is
  synced. By comparison, a sync adapter can access not only those columns, but many others,
  such as calendar color, time zone, access level, location, and so on.
However, a sync adapter is restricted to the <code>ACCOUNT_NAME</code> and 
<code>ACCOUNT_TYPE</code> it specified.</li> </ul>

<p>Here is a helper method you can use to return a URI for use with a sync adapter:</p>
<pre> static Uri asSyncAdapter(Uri uri, String account, String accountType) {
    return uri.buildUpon()
        .appendQueryParameter(android.provider.CalendarContract.CALLER_IS_SYNCADAPTER,&quot;true&quot;)
        .appendQueryParameter(Calendars.ACCOUNT_NAME, account)
        .appendQueryParameter(Calendars.ACCOUNT_TYPE, accountType).build();
 }
</pre>
<p>For a sample implementation of a sync adapter (not specifically related to Calendar), see 
<a href="{@docRoot}resources/samples/SampleSyncAdapter/index.html">SampleSyncAdapter</a>.
