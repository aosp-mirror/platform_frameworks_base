<p>The Android framework APIs provides a set 2D drawing APIs that allow you to render your own
custom graphics onto a canvas or to modify existing Views to customize their look and feel.
When drawing 2D graphics, you'll typically do so in one of two ways:</p>

<ol type="a">
  <li>Draw your graphics or animations into a View object from your layout. In this manner,
  the drawing of your graphics is handled by the system's
  normal View hierarchy drawing process &mdash; you simply define the graphics to go inside the View.</li>
  <li>Draw your graphics directly to a Canvas. This way, you personally call the appropriate class's
  {@link android.view.View#onDraw onDraw()} method (passing it your Canvas), or one of the Canvas
<code>draw...()</code> methods (like
  <code>{@link android.graphics.Canvas#drawPicture(Picture,Rect) drawPicture()}</code>). In doing so, you are also in
  control of any animation.</li>
</ol>

<p>Option "a," drawing to a View, is your best choice when you want to draw simple graphics that do not
need to change dynamically and are not part of a performance-intensive game. For example, you should
draw your graphics into a View when you want to display a static graphic or predefined animation, within
an otherwise static application. Read <a href="#drawables">Drawables</a> for more information.</li>
</p>

<p>Option "b," drawing to a Canvas, is better when your application needs to regularly re-draw itself.
Applications such as video games should be drawing to the Canvas on its own. However, there's more than
one way to do this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>In the same thread as your UI Activity, wherein you create a custom View component in
  your layout, call <code>{@link android.view.View#invalidate()}</code> and then handle the
  <code>{@link android.view.View#onDraw(Canvas) onDraw()}</code> callback.</li>
  <li>Or, in a separate thread, wherein you manage a {@link android.view.SurfaceView} and
  perform draws to the Canvas as fast as your thread is capable
  (you do not need to request <code>invalidate()</code>).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="draw-with-canvas">Draw with a Canvas</h2>

<p>When you're writing an application in which you would like to perform specialized drawing
and/or control the animation of graphics,
you should do so by drawing through a {@link android.graphics.Canvas}. A Canvas works for you as
a pretense, or interface, to the actual surface upon which your graphics will be drawn &mdash; it
holds all of your "draw" calls. Via the Canvas, your drawing is actually performed upon an
underlying {@link android.graphics.Bitmap}, which is placed into the window.</p>

<p>In the event that you're drawing within the <code>{@link android.view.View#onDraw(Canvas) onDraw()}</code>
callback method, the Canvas is provided for you and you need only place your drawing calls upon it.
You can also acquire a Canvas from <code>{@link android.view.SurfaceHolder#lockCanvas() SurfaceHolder.lockCanvas()}</code>,
when dealing with a SurfaceView object. (Both of these scenarios are discussed in the following sections.)
However, if you need to create a new Canvas, then you must define the {@link android.graphics.Bitmap}
upon which drawing will actually be performed. The Bitmap is always required for a Canvas. You can set up
a new Canvas like this:</p>
<pre>
Bitmap b = Bitmap.createBitmap(100, 100, Bitmap.Config.ARGB_8888);
Canvas c = new Canvas(b);
</pre>

<p>Now your Canvas will draw onto the defined Bitmap. After drawing upon it with the Canvas, you can then carry your
Bitmap to another Canvas with one of the <code>{@link android.graphics.Canvas#drawBitmap(Bitmap,Matrix,Paint)
Canvas.drawBitmap(Bitmap,...)}</code> methods. It's recommended that you ultimately draw your final
graphics through a Canvas offered to you
by <code>{@link android.view.View#onDraw(Canvas) View.onDraw()}</code> or
<code>{@link android.view.SurfaceHolder#lockCanvas() SurfaceHolder.lockCanvas()}</code> (see the following sections).</p>

<p>The {@link android.graphics.Canvas} class has its own set of drawing methods that you can use,
like <code>drawBitmap(...)</code>, <code>drawRect(...)</code>, <code>drawText(...)</code>, and many more.
Other classes that you might use also have <code>draw()</code> methods. For example, you'll probably
have some {@link android.graphics.drawable.Drawable} objects that you want to put on the Canvas. Drawable
has its own <code>{@link android.graphics.drawable.Drawable#draw(Canvas) draw()}</code> method
that takes your Canvas as an argument.</p>


<h3 id="on-view">On a View</h3>

<p>If your application does not require a significant amount of processing or
frame-rate speed (perhaps for a chess game, a snake game,
or another slowly-animated application), then you should consider creating a custom View component
and drawing with a Canvas in <code>{@link android.view.View#onDraw(Canvas) View.onDraw()}</code>.
The most convenient aspect of doing so is that the Android framework will
provide you with a pre-defined Canvas to which you will place your drawing calls.</p>

<p>To start, extend the {@link android.view.View} class (or descendant thereof) and define
the <code>{@link android.view.View#onDraw(Canvas) onDraw()}</code> callback method. This method will be called by the Android
framework to request that your View draw itself. This is where you will perform all your calls
to draw through the {@link android.graphics.Canvas}, which is passed to you through the <code>onDraw()</code> callback.</p>

<p>The Android framework will only call <code>onDraw()</code> as necessary. Each time that
your application is prepared to be drawn, you must request your View be invalidated by calling
<code>{@link android.view.View#invalidate()}</code>. This indicates that you'd like your View to be drawn and
Android will then call your <code>onDraw()</code> method (though is not guaranteed that the callback will
be instantaneous). </p>

<p>Inside your View component's <code>onDraw()</code>, use the Canvas given to you for all your drawing,
using various <code>Canvas.draw...()</code> methods, or other class <code>draw()</code> methods that
take your Canvas as an argument. Once your <code>onDraw()</code> is complete, the Android framework will
use your Canvas to draw a Bitmap handled by the system.</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Note: </strong> In order to request an invalidate from a thread other than your main
Activity's thread, you must call <code>{@link android.view.View#postInvalidate()}</code>.</p>

<p>For information about extending the {@link android.view.View} class, read
<a href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/ui/custom-components.html">Building Custom Components</a>.</p>

<p>For a sample application, see the Snake game, in the SDK samples folder:
<code>&lt;your-sdk-directory>/samples/Snake/</code>.</p>

<h3 id="on-surfaceview">On a SurfaceView</h3>

<p>The {@link android.view.SurfaceView} is a special subclass of View that offers a dedicated
drawing surface within the View hierarchy. The aim is to offer this drawing surface to
an application's secondary thread, so that the application isn't required
to wait until the system's View hierarchy is ready to draw. Instead, a secondary thread
that has reference to a SurfaceView can draw to its own Canvas at its own pace.</p>

<p>To begin, you need to create a new class that extends {@link android.view.SurfaceView}. The class should also
implement {@link android.view.SurfaceHolder.Callback}. This subclass is an interface that will notify you
with information about the underlying {@link android.view.Surface}, such as when it is created, changed, or destroyed.
These events  are important so that you know when you can start drawing, whether you need
to make adjustments based on new surface properties, and when to stop drawing and potentially
kill some tasks. Inside your SurfaceView class is also a good place to define your secondary Thread class, which will
perform all the drawing procedures to your Canvas.</p>

<p>Instead of handling the Surface object directly, you should handle it via
a {@link android.view.SurfaceHolder}. So, when your SurfaceView is initialized, get the SurfaceHolder by calling
<code>{@link android.view.SurfaceView#getHolder()}</code>. You should then notify the SurfaceHolder that you'd
like to receive SurfaceHolder callbacks (from {@link android.view.SurfaceHolder.Callback}) by calling
{@link android.view.SurfaceHolder#addCallback(SurfaceHolder.Callback) addCallback()}
(pass it <var>this</var>). Then override each of the
{@link android.view.SurfaceHolder.Callback} methods inside your SurfaceView class.</p>

<p>In order to draw to the Surface Canvas from within your second thread, you must pass the thread your SurfaceHandler
and retrieve the Canvas with <code>{@link android.view.SurfaceHolder#lockCanvas() lockCanvas()}</code>.
You can now take the Canvas given to you by the SurfaceHolder and do your necessary drawing upon it.
Once you're done drawing with the Canvas, call
<code>{@link android.view.SurfaceHolder#unlockCanvasAndPost(Canvas) unlockCanvasAndPost()}</code>, passing it
your Canvas object. The Surface will now draw the Canvas as you left it. Perform this sequence of locking and
unlocking the canvas each time you want to redraw.</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> On each pass you retrieve the Canvas from the SurfaceHolder,
the previous state of the Canvas will be retained. In order to properly animate your graphics, you must re-paint the
entire surface. For example, you can clear the previous state of the Canvas by filling in a color
with <code>{@link android.graphics.Canvas#drawColor(int) drawColor()}</code> or setting a background image
with <code>{@link android.graphics.Canvas#drawBitmap(Bitmap,Rect,RectF,Paint) drawBitmap()}</code>. Otherwise,
you will see traces of the drawings you previously performed.</p>


<p>For a sample application, see the Lunar Lander game, in the SDK samples folder:
<code>&lt;your-sdk-directory>/samples/LunarLander/</code>. Or,
browse the source in the <a href="{@docRoot}guide/samples/index.html">Sample Code</a> section.</p>

<h2 id="drawables">Drawables</h2>
<p>Android offers a custom 2D graphics library for drawing shapes and images.
  The {@link android.graphics.drawable} package is where you'll find the common classes used for
  drawing in two-dimensions.</p>

<p>This document discusses the basics of using Drawable objects to draw graphics and how to use a
couple subclasses of the Drawable class. For information on using Drawables to do frame-by-frame
animation, see <a href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/graphics/drawable-animation.html">Drawable
Animation</a>.</p>

<p>A {@link android.graphics.drawable.Drawable} is a general abstraction for "something that can be
  drawn."  You'll discover that the Drawable class extends to define a variety of specific kinds of
drawable graphics, including {@link android.graphics.drawable.BitmapDrawable}, {@link
  android.graphics.drawable.ShapeDrawable}, {@link android.graphics.drawable.PictureDrawable},
{@link android.graphics.drawable.LayerDrawable}, and several more.  Of course, you can also extend
these to define your own custom Drawable objects that behave in unique ways.</p>

<p>There are three ways to define and instantiate a Drawable: using an image saved in your project
  resources; using an XML file that defines the Drawable properties; or using the normal class
constructors. Below, we'll discuss each the first two techniques (using constructors is nothing new
for an experienced developer).</p>


<h3 id="drawables-from-images">Creating from resource images</h3>

<p>A simple way to add graphics to your application is by referencing an image file from your
  project resources. Supported file types are PNG (preferred), JPG (acceptable) and GIF
(discouraged). This technique would obviously be preferred for application icons, logos, or other
graphics such as those used in a game.</p>

<p>To use an image resource, just add your file to the <code>res/drawable/</code> directory of your
  project. From there, you can reference it from your code or your XML layout.
  Either way, it is referred using a resource ID, which is the file name without the file type
  extension (E.g., <code>my_image.png</code> is referenced as <var>my_image</var>).</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Image resources placed in <code>res/drawable/</code> may be
  automatically optimized with lossless image compression by the
  <code>aapt</code> tool during the build process. For example, a true-color PNG that does
  not require more than 256 colors may be converted to an 8-bit PNG with a color palette. This
  will result in an image of equal quality but which requires less memory. So be aware that the
  image binaries placed in this directory can change during the build. If you plan on reading
  an image as a bit stream in order to convert it to a bitmap, put your images in the
  <code>res/raw/</code> folder instead, where they will not be optimized.</p>

<h4>Example code</h4>
<p>The following code snippet demonstrates how to build an {@link android.widget.ImageView} that
  uses an image from drawable resources and add it to the layout.</p>
<pre>
  LinearLayout mLinearLayout;

  protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
  super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);

  // Create a LinearLayout in which to add the ImageView
  mLinearLayout = new LinearLayout(this);

  // Instantiate an ImageView and define its properties
  ImageView i = new ImageView(this);
  i.setImageResource(R.drawable.my_image);
  i.setAdjustViewBounds(true); // set the ImageView bounds to match the Drawable's dimensions
  i.setLayoutParams(new Gallery.LayoutParams(LayoutParams.WRAP_CONTENT,
  LayoutParams.WRAP_CONTENT));

  // Add the ImageView to the layout and set the layout as the content view
  mLinearLayout.addView(i);
  setContentView(mLinearLayout);
  }
</pre>
<p>In other cases, you may want to handle your image resource as a
  {@link android.graphics.drawable.Drawable} object.
  To do so, create a Drawable from the resource like so:
  <pre>
    Resources res = mContext.getResources();
    Drawable myImage = res.getDrawable(R.drawable.my_image);
  </pre>

  <p class="warning"><strong>Note:</strong> Each unique resource in your project can maintain only
one state, no matter how many different objects you may instantiate for it. For example, if you
    instantiate two Drawable objects from the same image resource, then change a property (such
as the alpha) for one of the Drawables, then it will also affect the other. So when dealing with
multiple instances of an image resource, instead of directly transforming the Drawable, you
should perform a <a href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/graphics/view-animation.html#tween-animation">tween
animation</a>.</p>


  <h4>Example XML</h4>
  <p>The XML snippet below shows how to add a resource Drawable to an
    {@link android.widget.ImageView} in the XML layout (with some red tint just for fun).
    <pre>
      &lt;ImageView
      android:layout_width="wrap_content"
      android:layout_height="wrap_content"
      android:tint="#55ff0000"
      android:src="@drawable/my_image"/>
  </pre>
  <p>For more information on using project resources, read about
    <a href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/resources/index.html">Resources and Assets</a>.</p>


  <h3 id="drawables-from-xml">Creating from resource XML</h3>

  <p>By now, you should be familiar with Android's principles of developing a
    <a href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/ui/index.html">User Interface</a>. Hence, you understand the
power and flexibility inherent in defining objects in XML. This philosophy caries over from Views
to Drawables.  If there is a Drawable object that you'd like to create, which is not initially
dependent on variables defined by your application code or user interaction, then defining the
Drawable in XML is a good option. Even if you expect your Drawable to change its properties
during the user's experience with your application, you should consider defining the object in
XML, as you can always modify properties once it is instantiated.</p>

  <p>Once you've defined your Drawable in XML, save the file in the <code>res/drawable/</code>
    directory of your project. Then, retrieve and instantiate the object by calling
    {@link android.content.res.Resources#getDrawable(int) Resources.getDrawable()}, passing it the
    resource ID of your XML file. (See the <a href="#drawable-xml-example">example
below</a>.)</p>

  <p>Any Drawable subclass that supports the <code>inflate()</code> method can be defined in
    XML and instantiated by your application. Each Drawable that supports XML inflation utilizes
specific XML attributes that help define the object
    properties (see the class reference to see what these are). See the class documentation for each
    Drawable subclass for information on how to define it in XML.

    <h4 id="drawable-xml-example">Example</h4>
    <p>Here's some XML that defines a TransitionDrawable:</p>
    <pre>
      &lt;transition xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
      &lt;item android:drawable="&#64;drawable/image_expand">
      &lt;item android:drawable="&#64;drawable/image_collapse">
      &lt;/transition>
    </pre>

    <p>With this XML saved in the file <code>res/drawable/expand_collapse.xml</code>,
      the following code will instantiate the TransitionDrawable and set it as the content of an
      ImageView:</p>
    <pre>
      Resources res = mContext.getResources();
      TransitionDrawable transition = (TransitionDrawable)
res.getDrawable(R.drawable.expand_collapse);
      ImageView image = (ImageView) findViewById(R.id.toggle_image);
      image.setImageDrawable(transition);
    </pre>
    <p>Then this transition can be run forward (for 1 second) with:</p>
    <pre>transition.startTransition(1000);</pre>

    <p>Refer to the Drawable classes listed above for more information on the XML attributes
supported by each.</p>



    <h2 id="shape-drawable">Shape Drawable</h2>

    <p>When you want to dynamically draw some two-dimensional graphics, a {@link
      android.graphics.drawable.ShapeDrawable}
      object will probably suit your needs. With a ShapeDrawable, you can programmatically draw
      primitive shapes and style them in any way imaginable.</p>

    <p>A ShapeDrawable is an extension of {@link android.graphics.drawable.Drawable}, so you can use
one      where ever
      a Drawable is expected &mdash; perhaps for the background of a View, set with
      {@link android.view.View#setBackgroundDrawable(android.graphics.drawable.Drawable)
      setBackgroundDrawable()}.
      Of course, you can also draw your shape as its own custom {@link android.view.View},
      to be added to your layout however you please.
      Because the ShapeDrawable has its own <code>draw()</code> method, you can create a subclass of
View      that
      draws the ShapeDrawable during the <code>View.onDraw()</code> method.
      Here's a basic extension of the View class that does just this, to draw a ShapeDrawable as a
      View:</p>
    <pre>
      public class CustomDrawableView extends View {
      private ShapeDrawable mDrawable;

      public CustomDrawableView(Context context) {
      super(context);

      int x = 10;
      int y = 10;
      int width = 300;
      int height = 50;

      mDrawable = new ShapeDrawable(new OvalShape());
      mDrawable.getPaint().setColor(0xff74AC23);
      mDrawable.setBounds(x, y, x + width, y + height);
      }

      protected void onDraw(Canvas canvas) {
      mDrawable.draw(canvas);
      }
      }
    </pre>

    <p>In the constructor, a ShapeDrawable is defines as an {@link
      android.graphics.drawable.shapes.OvalShape}.
      It's then given a color and the bounds of the shape are set. If you do not set the bounds,
then the
      shape will not be drawn, whereas if you don't set the color, it will default to black.</p>
    <p>With the custom View defined, it can be drawn any way you like. With the sample above, we can
      draw the shape programmatically in an Activity:</p>
    <pre>
      CustomDrawableView mCustomDrawableView;

      protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
      super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
      mCustomDrawableView = new CustomDrawableView(this);

      setContentView(mCustomDrawableView);
      }
    </pre>

    <p>If you'd like to draw this custom drawable from the XML layout instead of from the Activity,
      then the CustomDrawable class must override the {@link
      android.view.View#View(android.content.Context, android.util.AttributeSet) View(Context,
      AttributeSet)} constructor, which is called when
      instantiating a View via inflation from XML. Then add a CustomDrawable element to the XML,
      like so:</p>
    <pre>
      &lt;com.example.shapedrawable.CustomDrawableView
      android:layout_width="fill_parent"
      android:layout_height="wrap_content"
      />
  </pre>

  <p>The ShapeDrawable class (like many other Drawable types in the {@link
android.graphics.drawable}    package)
    allows you to define various properties of the drawable with public methods.
    Some properties you might want to adjust include
    alpha transparency, color filter, dither, opacity and color.</p>

  <p>You can also define primitive drawable shapes using XML. For more information, see the
    section about Shape Drawables in the <a

href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/resources/drawable-resource.html#Shape">Drawable Resources</a>
    document.</p>

  <!-- TODO
       <h2 id="state-list">StateListDrawable</h2>

       <p>A StateListDrawable is an extension of the DrawableContainer class, making it  little
different.
         The primary distinction is that the
         StateListDrawable manages a collection of images for the Drawable, instead of just one.
         This means that it can switch the image when you want, without switching objects. However,
the
         intention of the StateListDrawable is to automatically change the image used based on the
state
         of the object it's attached to.
         -->

         <h2 id="nine-patch">Nine-patch</h2>

         <p>A {@link android.graphics.drawable.NinePatchDrawable} graphic is a stretchable bitmap
image,           which Android
           will automatically resize to accommodate the contents of the View in which you have
placed it as the           background.
           An example use of a NinePatch is the backgrounds used by standard Android buttons &mdash;
           buttons must stretch to accommodate strings of various lengths. A NinePatch drawable is a
standard           PNG
           image that includes an extra 1-pixel-wide border. It must be saved with the extension
           <code>.9.png</code>,
           and saved into the <code>res/drawable/</code> directory of your project.
         </p>
         <p>
           The border is used to define the stretchable and static areas of
           the image. You indicate a stretchable section by drawing one (or more) 1-pixel-wide
           black line(s) in the left and top part of the border (the other border pixels should
           be fully transparent or white). You can have as many stretchable sections as you want:
           their relative size stays the same, so the largest sections always remain the largest.
         </p>
         <p>
           You can also define an optional drawable section of the image (effectively,
           the padding lines) by drawing a line on the right and bottom lines.
           If a View object sets the NinePatch as its background and then specifies the
           View's text, it will stretch itself so that all the text fits inside only
           the area designated by the right and bottom lines (if included). If the
           padding lines are not included, Android uses the left and top lines to
           define this drawable area.
         </p>
         <p>To clarify the difference between the different lines, the left and top lines define
           which pixels of the image are allowed to be replicated in order to stretch the image.
           The bottom and right lines define the relative area within the image that the contents
           of the View are allowed to lie within.</p>
         <p>
           Here is a sample NinePatch file used to define a button:
         </p>
         <img src="{@docRoot}images/ninepatch_raw.png" alt="" />

         <p>This NinePatch defines one stretchable area with the left and top lines
           and the drawable area with the bottom and right lines. In the top image, the dotted grey
           lines identify the regions of the image that will be replicated in order to stretch the
image. The           pink
           rectangle in the bottom image identifies the region in which the contents of the View are
allowed.
           If the contents don't fit in this region, then the image will be stretched so that they
do.
</p>

<p>The <a href="{@docRoot}tools/help/draw9patch.html">Draw 9-patch</a> tool offers
   an extremely handy way to create your NinePatch images, using a WYSIWYG graphics editor. It
even raises warnings if the region you've defined for the stretchable area is at risk of
producing drawing artifacts as a result of the pixel replication.
</p>

<h3>Example XML</h3>

<p>Here's some sample layout XML that demonstrates how to add a NinePatch image to a
couple of buttons. (The NinePatch image is saved as
<code>res/drawable/my_button_background.9.png</code>
<pre>
&lt;Button id="@+id/tiny"
        android:layout_width="wrap_content"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        android:layout_alignParentTop="true"
        android:layout_centerInParent="true"
        android:text="Tiny"
        android:textSize="8sp"
        android:background="@drawable/my_button_background"/&gt;

&lt;Button id="@+id/big"
        android:layout_width="wrap_content"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        android:layout_alignParentBottom="true"
        android:layout_centerInParent="true"
        android:text="Biiiiiiig text!"
        android:textSize="30sp"
        android:background="@drawable/my_button_background"/&gt;
</pre>
<p>Note that the width and height are set to "wrap_content" to make the button fit neatly around the
text.
</p>

<p>Below are the two buttons rendered from the XML and NinePatch image shown above.
Notice how the width and height of the button varies with the text, and the background image
stretches to accommodate it.
