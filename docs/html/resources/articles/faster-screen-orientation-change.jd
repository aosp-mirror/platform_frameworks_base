<p>Android is designed to run efficiently on a wide
array of devices, with very different hardware configurations. Some
devices, like the T-Mobile G1, can change their hardware configuration
at runtime. For instance, when you open the keyboard, the screen change
from the portrait orientation to the landscape orientation.

<h2>Using the alternate resources framework</h2>

<p>The platform's support for loading orientation-specific
resources at run time is based on the alternate resources framework.</p>

<p>Providing orientation-specific resources is an important part of 
developing your app. If you are not familiar with resource directory qualifiers 
or how the platform uses them, please read 
<a href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/resources/resources-i18n.html#AlternateResources">
Alternate Resources</a>.

<p>To make
Android app development easier, the Android system automatically handles
configuration change events and restarts the current activity with the new
configuration. This is the default behavior that lets you declare
resources like layouts and drawables based on the orientation, screen
size, locale, etc. </p>

<p>While this behavior is really powerful, since your application adapts
automatically to the device's configuration at runtime, it is sometimes
confusing for new Android developers, who wonder why their activity is
destroyed and recreated. </p>

<p>Facing this "issue," some developers choose to handle configuration changes
themselves which is, in general, a short-term solution that will only complicate
their lives later. On the other hand, the system's automatic resource handling
is a very efficient and easy way to adapt an application's user interface to
various devices and devices configurations. It sometimes comes at a price,
though.</p>

<p>When your application displays a lot of data, or data that is expensive to fetch,
the automatic destruction/creation of the activities can be lead to a
painful user experience. Take the example of <a href="http://code.google.com/p/apps-for-android/source/browse/trunk/Photostream/">Photostream</a>,
a simple Flickr browsing application. After you launch the application and choose a Flickr account, the
application downloads a set of 6 photos (on a T-Mobile G1) from the
Flickr servers and displays them on screen. To improve the user
experience, the application uses slightly different layouts and drawables in
portrait and landscape modes and this is what the result looks like:</p>

<p><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_9l0GmPwgCzk/SZoGyJyg6-I/AAAAAAAAACU/ItuVwhegPb8/s1600-h/photostream_landscape.png"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 214px;" src="images/photostream_landscape.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5303558969873198050" border="0"></a></p>

<p>Photostream lets Android take care of the configuration change when the
screen is rotated. However, can you imagine how painful it would be for the user
to see all the images being downloaded again? The obvious solution to this
problem is to temporarily cache the images. They could be cached on the SD card
(if there's one), in the Application object, in a static field, etc. None of
these techniques is adapted to the current situation: why should we bother
caching the images when the screen is not rotated? Fortunately for us, Android
offers a great API exactly for that purpose.</p>

<p>The Activity class has a special method called 
{@link android.app.Activity#onRetainNonConfigurationInstance()}. This method 
can be used to pass an arbitrary object <em>your future self</em> and Android 
is smart enough to call this method only when needed. In the case of Photostream, 
the application <a href="http://code.google.com/p/apps-for-android/source/browse/trunk/Photostream/src/com/google/android/photostream/PhotostreamActivity.java#226">used this method</a>
to pass the downloaded images to the future activity on orientation change. 
The implementation can be summarized like so:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">&#64;Override
public Object onRetainNonConfigurationInstance() {
    final LoadedPhoto[] list = new LoadedPhoto[numberOfPhotos];
    keepPhotos(list);
    return list;
}
</pre>

<p>In the new activity, in <code>onCreate()</code>, all you have to do to 
get your object back is to call {@link android.app.Activity#getLastNonConfigurationInstance()}. 
In Photostream, <a href="http://code.google.com/p/apps-for-android/source/browse/trunk/Photostream/src/com/google/android/photostream/PhotostreamActivity.java#251">this method is invoked</a> 
and if the returned value is not null, the grid is loaded with the list of 
photos from the previous activity:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">private void loadPhotos() {
    final Object data = getLastNonConfigurationInstance();
    
    // The activity is starting for the first time, load the photos from Flickr
    if (data == null) {
        mTask = new GetPhotoListTask().execute(mCurrentPage);
    } else {
        // The activity was destroyed/created automatically, populate the grid
        // of photos with the images loaded by the previous activity
        final LoadedPhoto[] photos = (LoadedPhoto[]) data;
        for (LoadedPhoto photo : photos) {
            addPhoto(photo);
        }
    }
}
</pre>

<p>Be very careful with the object you pass through 
<code>onRetainNonConfigurationChange()</code>, though. If the object you 
pass is for some reason tied to the Activity/Context, <a 
href="http://www.curious-creature.org/2008/12/18/avoid-memory-leaks-on-android/">you will leak</a>
all the views and resources of the activity. This means you should
never pass a View, a Drawable, an Adapter, etc. Photostream for
instance extracts the bitmaps from the drawables and pass the bitmaps
only, not the drawables. Finally, remember that 
<code>onRetainNonConfigurationChange()</code> should be used only to retain 
data that is expensive to load. Otherwise, keep it simple and let Android 
do everything.</p>
