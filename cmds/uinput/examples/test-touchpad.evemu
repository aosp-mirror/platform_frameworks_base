# EVEMU 1.2
# This is an evemu "recording" of an Apple Magic Trackpad (1st generation), but
# that doesn't actually make any movements. It just runs for a very long time,
# to make Android think a touchpad is connected. This is useful for testing
# things like the settings in System > Touchpad, which only appear when one is
# connected.
#
# It can be played by piping it to the uinput command over ADB:
#     $ adb shell uinput - < test-touchpad.evemu
N: Fake touchpad
