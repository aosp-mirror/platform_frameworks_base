# Script to start "uiautomator" on the device
#
# The script does a couple of things:
# * Use an alternative dalvik cache when running as non-root. Jar file needs
#   to be dexopt'd to run in Dalvik. For plain jar files, this is done at first
#   use. shell user does not have write permission to default system Dalvik
#   cache so we redirect to an alternative cache
# * special processing for subcommand 'runtest':
#    * '--nohup' allows process continue to run even if parent process that
#      started it has already terminated. We parse for this parameter and set
#      signal trap. This is useful for testing with USB disconnected
#    * all jar files that the test classes resides in, or dependent on are
#      provided on command line and exported to CLASSPATH environment variable
#      before starting the Java code. This offloads the task of class loading
#      and resolving of cross jar class dependency to Dalvik
#    * all other subcommand or options are directly passed into Java code for
#      further parsing
