 * *****************************************************************************
 * Below are all of the individual atoms that are logged by Android via statsd
 * and Westworld.
 *
 * RULES:
 *   - The field ids for each atom must start at 1, and count upwards by 1.
 *     Skipping field ids is not allowed.
 *   - These form an API, so renaming, renumbering or removing fields is
 *     not allowed between android releases.  (This is not currently enforced,
 *     but there will be a tool to enforce this restriction).
 *   - The types must be built-in protocol buffer types, namely, no sub-messages
 *     are allowed (yet).  The bytes type is also not allowed.
 *   - The CamelCase name of the message type should match the
 *     underscore_separated name as defined in StatsEvent.
 *   - If an atom represents work that can be attributed to an app, there can
 *     be exactly one WorkSource field. It must be field number 1.
 *   - A field that is a uid should be a string field, tagged with the [xxx]
 *     annotation. The generated code on android will be represented by UIDs,
 *     and those UIDs will be translated in xxx to those strings.
 *
 * CONVENTIONS:
 *   - Events are past tense. e.g. ScreenStateChanged, not ScreenStateChange.
 *   - If there is a UID, it goes first. Think in an object-oriented fashion.
