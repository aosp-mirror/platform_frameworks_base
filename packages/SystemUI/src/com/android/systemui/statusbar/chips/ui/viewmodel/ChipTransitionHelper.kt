/**
 * A class that can help [OngoingActivityChipViewModel] instances with various transition states.
 *
 * For now, this class's only functionality is immediately hiding the chip if the user has tapped an
 * activity chip and then clicked "Stop" on the resulting dialog. There's a bit of a delay between
 * when the user clicks "Stop" and when the system services notify SysUI that the activity has
 * indeed stopped. We don't want the chip to briefly show for a few frames during that delay, so
 * this class helps us immediately hide the chip as soon as the user clicks "Stop" in the dialog.
 * See b/353249803#comment4.
