/**
 * A cache in which entries can "survive" getting purged [retainCount] times, given consecutive
 * [purge] calls made at least [purgeTimeoutMillis] apart. See also [purge].
 *
 * This cache is safe for multithreaded usage, and is recommended for objects that take a while to
 * resolve (such as drawables, or things that require binder calls). As such, [getOrFetch] is
 * recommended to be run on a background thread, while [purge] can be done from any thread.
 *
 * Important: This cache does NOT have a maximum size, cleaning it up (via [purge]) is the
 * responsibility of the caller, to avoid keeping things in memory unnecessarily.
