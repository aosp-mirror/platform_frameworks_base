     * The [TransitionInfo] of the most recent call to
     * [KeyguardTransitionRepository.startTransition].
     *
     * This should only be used by keyguard transition internals (From*TransitionInteractor and
     * related classes). Other consumers of keyguard state in System UI should use
     * [startedKeyguardState], [currentKeyguardState], and related flows.
     *
     * Keyguard internals use this to determine the most up-to-date KeyguardState that we've
     * requested a transition to, even if the animator running the transition on the main thread has
     * not yet emitted the STARTED TransitionStep.
     *
     * For example: if we're finished in GONE and press the power button twice very quickly, we may
     * request a transition to AOD, but then receive the second power button press prior to the
     * STARTED -> AOD transition step emitting. We still need the FromAodTransitionInteractor to
     * request a transition from AOD -> LOCKSCREEN in response to the power press, even though the
     * main thread animator hasn't emitted STARTED > AOD yet (which means [startedKeyguardState] is
     * still GONE, which is not relevant to FromAodTransitionInteractor). In this case, the
     * interactor can use this current transition info to determine that a STARTED -> AOD step
     * *will* be emitted, and therefore that it can safely request an AOD -> LOCKSCREEN transition
     * which will subsequently cancel GONE -> AOD.
