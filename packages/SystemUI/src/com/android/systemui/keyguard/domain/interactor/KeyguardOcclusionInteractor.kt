/**
 * Logic related to keyguard occlusion. The keyguard is occluded when an activity with
 * FLAG_SHOW_WHEN_LOCKED is on top of the activity task stack, with that activity displaying on top
 * of ("occluding") the lockscreen UI. Common examples of this are Google Maps Navigation and the
 * secure camera.
 *
 * This should usually be used only by keyguard internal classes. Most System UI use cases should
 * use [KeyguardTransitionInteractor] to see if we're in [KeyguardState.OCCLUDED] instead.
