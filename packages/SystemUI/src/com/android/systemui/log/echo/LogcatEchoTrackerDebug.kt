/**
 * A version of [LogcatEchoTracker] that supports fine-grained echoing of log messages to logcat,
 * filtered by buffer, tag, and log level.
 *
 * Filters can be added and removed via a shell command (`adb shell cmd statusbar echo`). See
 * [LogcatEchoTrackerCommand] for details.
 *
 * Note that some log messages may fail to be echoed while the systemui process is first starting
 * up, before we load the echo settings.

    // This class uses a single-writer, many-readers pattern that allows us to avoid the need for
    // locking. In this case, this means that our shared state (the override maps) can be _read_ by
    // any number of threads, but they're always written to by a single thread (dispatched by
    // sequentialBgDispatcher). Such a pattern allows us to use the more performant @Volatile below
    // instead of synchronization locks.
    //
    // Okay: some of what I just told you is a lie. sequentialBgDispatcher does not dispatch to a
    // single thread. Instead, it guarantees that all work it schedules is _sequential_, meaning
    // that Job B cannot start until Job A ends (this is actually a stronger guarantee than single-
    // threaded execution due to the possibility of suspend functions). Because
    // sequentialBgDispatcher is dispatching from the Dispatchers.IO thread pool, each individual
    // "write" job might run on a different thread from that pool. However, because we are
    // enforcing sequential execution, exactly which thread an individual write job runs on doesn't
    // matter.

    // Okay. So. Why are these @Volatile. We've eliminated the need for synchronization primitives,
    // but now we must contend with thread memory caching. Without an explicit synchronization
    // signal, other threads may see "stale" versions of our state when they try to read from these
    // maps, even after they've been updated by the writer thread. @Volatile solves this problem:
    // it eliminates the possibility of stale reads while still being much more performant than
    // locking.
