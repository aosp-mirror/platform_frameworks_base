# R8's full mode is a bit more aggressive in stripping annotations, but the
# SystemUI plugin architecture requires these annotations at runtime. The
# following rules are the minimal set necessary to ensure compatibility.
# For more details, see:
# https://r8.googlesource.com/r8/+/refs/heads/master/compatibility-faq.md#r8-full-mode
-keepattributes RuntimeVisible*Annotation*,AnnotationDefault

-keep interface com.android.systemui.plugins.annotations.** {
    *;
}
# TODO(b/373579455): Evaluate if <init> needs to be kept.
-keep,allowshrinking,allowoptimization,allowobfuscation,allowaccessmodification @com.android.systemui.plugins.annotations.** class * {
    void <init>();
}
