/**
 * Interface for listening to plugins being connected and disconnected.
 *
 * The call order for a plugin is
 *  1) {@link #onPluginAttached}
 *          Called when a new plugin is added to the device, or an existing plugin was replaced by
 *          the package manager. Will only be called once per package manager event. If multiple
 *          non-conflicting packages which have the same plugin interface are installed on the
 *          device, then this method can be called multiple times with different instances of
 *          {@link PluginLifecycleManager} (as long as `allowMultiple` was set to true when the
 *          listener was registered with {@link PluginManager#addPluginListener}).
 *  2) {@link #onPluginLoaded}
 *          Called whenever a new instance of the plugin object is created and ready for use. Can be
 *          called multiple times per {@link PluginLifecycleManager}, but will always pass a newly
 *          created plugin object. {@link #onPluginUnloaded} with the previous plugin object will
 *          be called before another call to {@link #onPluginLoaded} is made. This method will be
 *          called once automatically after {@link #onPluginAttached}. Besides the initial call,
 *          {@link #onPluginLoaded} will occur due to {@link PluginLifecycleManager#loadPlugin}.
 *  3) {@link #onPluginUnloaded}
 *          Called when a request to unload the plugin has been received. This can be triggered from
 *          a related call to {@link PluginLifecycleManager#unloadPlugin} or for any reason that
 *          {@link #onPluginDetached} would be triggered.
 *  4) {@link #onPluginDetached}
 *          Called when the package is removed from the device, disabled, or replaced due to an
 *          external trigger. These are events from the android package manager.
 *
 * @param <T> is the target plugin type
