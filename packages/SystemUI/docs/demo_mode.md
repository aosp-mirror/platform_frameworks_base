# Demo Mode for the Android System UI
*Demo mode for the status bar allows you to force the status bar into a fixed state, useful for taking screenshots with a consistent status bar state, or testing different status icon permutations. Demo mode is available in recent versions of Android.*

## Enabling demo mode
Demo mode is protected behind a system setting. To enable it for a device, run:

```
adb shell settings put global sysui_demo_allowed 1
```

## Protocol
The protocol is based on broadcast intents, and thus can be driven via the command line (```adb shell am broadcast```) or an app (```Context.sendBroadcast```).

### Broadcast action
```
com.android.systemui.demo
```

### Commands
Commands and subcommands (below) are sent as string extras in the broadcast
intent.
<br/>
Commands are sent as string extras with key ```command``` (required). Possible values are:

| Command              | Subcommand                 | Argument         | Description
