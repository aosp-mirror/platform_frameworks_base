 * <h3>State Diagram</h3>
 *
 * <p>Playback control of audio/video files and streams is managed as a state
 * machine. The following diagram shows the life cycle and the states of a
 * MediaPlayer object driven by the supported playback control operations.
 * The ovals represent the states a MediaPlayer object may reside
 * in. The arcs represent the playback control operations that drive the object
 * state transition. There are two types of arcs. The arcs with a single arrow
 * head represent synchronous method calls, while those with
 * a double arrow head represent asynchronous method calls.</p>
 *
 * <p><img src="../../../images/mediaplayer_state_diagram.gif"
 *         alt="MediaPlayer State diagram"
 *         border="0" /></p>
 *
 * <p>From this state diagram, one can see that a MediaPlayer object has the
 *    following states:</p>
 * <ul>
 *     <li>When a MediaPlayer object is just created using <code>new</code> or
 *         after {@link #reset()} is called, it is in the <em>Idle</em> state; and after
 *         {@link #release()} is called, it is in the <em>End</em> state. Between these
 *         two states is the life cycle of the MediaPlayer object.
 *         <ul>
 *         <li>There is a subtle but important difference between a newly constructed
 *         MediaPlayer object and the MediaPlayer object after {@link #reset()}
 *         is called. It is a programming error to invoke methods such
 *         as {@link #getCurrentPosition()},
 *         {@link #getDuration()}, {@link #getVideoHeight()},
 *         {@link #getVideoWidth()}, {@link #setAudioStreamType(int)},
 *         {@link #setLooping(boolean)},
 *         {@link #setVolume(float, float)}, {@link #pause()}, {@link #start()},
 *         {@link #stop()}, {@link #seekTo(int)}, {@link #prepare()} or
 *         {@link #prepareAsync()} in the <em>Idle</em> state for both cases. If any of these
 *         methods is called right after a MediaPlayer object is constructed,
 *         the user supplied callback method OnErrorListener.onError() won't be
 *         called by the internal player engine and the object state remains
 *         unchanged; but if these methods are called right after {@link #reset()},
 *         the user supplied callback method OnErrorListener.onError() will be
 *         invoked by the internal player engine and the object will be
 *         transfered to the <em>Error</em> state. </li>
 *         <li>It is also recommended that once
 *         a MediaPlayer object is no longer being used, call {@link #release()} immediately
 *         so that resources used by the internal player engine associated with the
 *         MediaPlayer object can be released immediately. Resource may include
 *         singleton resources such as hardware acceleration components and
 *         failure to call {@link #release()} may cause subsequent instances of
 *         MediaPlayer objects to fallback to software implementations or fail
 *         altogether. Once the MediaPlayer
 *         object is in the <em>End</em> state, it can no longer be used and
 *         there is no way to bring it back to any other state. </li>
 *         <li>Furthermore,
 *         the MediaPlayer objects created using <code>new</code> is in the
 *         <em>Idle</em> state, while those created with one
 *         of the overloaded convenient <code>create</code> methods are <em>NOT</em>
 *         in the <em>Idle</em> state. In fact, the objects are in the <em>Prepared</em>
 *         state if the creation using <code>create</code> method is successful.
 *         </li>
 *         </ul>
 *         </li>
 *     <li>In general, some playback control operation may fail due to various
 *         reasons, such as unsupported audio/video format, poorly interleaved
 *         audio/video, resolution too high, streaming timeout, and the like.
 *         Thus, error reporting and recovery is an important concern under
 *         these circumstances. Sometimes, due to programming errors, invoking a playback
 *         control operation in an invalid state may also occur. Under all these
 *         error conditions, the internal player engine invokes a user supplied
 *         OnErrorListener.onError() method if an OnErrorListener has been
 *         registered beforehand via
 *         {@link #setOnErrorListener(android.media.MediaPlayer.OnErrorListener)}.
 *         <ul>
 *         <li>It is important to note that once an error occurs, the
 *         MediaPlayer object enters the <em>Error</em> state (except as noted
 *         above), even if an error listener has not been registered by the application.</li>
 *         <li>In order to reuse a MediaPlayer object that is in the <em>
 *         Error</em> state and recover from the error,
 *         {@link #reset()} can be called to restore the object to its <em>Idle</em>
 *         state.</li>
 *         <li>It is good programming practice to have your application
 *         register a OnErrorListener to look out for error notifications from
 *         the internal player engine.</li>
 *         <li>IllegalStateException is
 *         thrown to prevent programming errors such as calling {@link #prepare()},
 *         {@link #prepareAsync()}, or one of the overloaded <code>setDataSource
 *         </code> methods in an invalid state. </li>
 *         </ul>
 *         </li>
 *     <li>Calling
 *         {@link #setDataSource(FileDescriptor)}, or
 *         {@link #setDataSource(String)}, or
 *         {@link #setDataSource(Context, Uri)}, or
 *         {@link #setDataSource(FileDescriptor, long, long)} transfers a
 *         MediaPlayer object in the <em>Idle</em> state to the
 *         <em>Initialized</em> state.
 *         <ul>
 *         <li>An IllegalStateException is thrown if
 *         setDataSource() is called in any other state.</li>
 *         <li>It is good programming
 *         practice to always look out for <code>IllegalArgumentException</code>
 *         and <code>IOException</code> that may be thrown from the overloaded
 *         <code>setDataSource</code> methods.</li>
 *         </ul>
 *         </li>
 *     <li>A MediaPlayer object must first enter the <em>Prepared</em> state
 *         before playback can be started.
 *         <ul>
 *         <li>There are two ways (synchronous vs.
 *         asynchronous) that the <em>Prepared</em> state can be reached:
 *         either a call to {@link #prepare()} (synchronous) which
 *         transfers the object to the <em>Prepared</em> state once the method call
 *         returns, or a call to {@link #prepareAsync()} (asynchronous) which
 *         first transfers the object to the <em>Preparing</em> state after the
 *         call returns (which occurs almost right way) while the internal
 *         player engine continues working on the rest of preparation work
 *         until the preparation work completes. When the preparation completes or when {@link #prepare()} call returns,
 *         the internal player engine then calls a user supplied callback method,
 *         onPrepared() of the OnPreparedListener interface, if an
 *         OnPreparedListener is registered beforehand via {@link
 *         #setOnPreparedListener(android.media.MediaPlayer.OnPreparedListener)}.</li>
 *         <li>It is important to note that
 *         the <em>Preparing</em> state is a transient state, and the behavior
 *         of calling any method with side effect while a MediaPlayer object is
 *         in the <em>Preparing</em> state is undefined.</li>
 *         <li>An IllegalStateException is
 *         thrown if {@link #prepare()} or {@link #prepareAsync()} is called in
 *         any other state.</li>
 *         <li>While in the <em>Prepared</em> state, properties
 *         such as audio/sound volume, screenOnWhilePlaying, looping can be
 *         adjusted by invoking the corresponding set methods.</li>
 *         </ul>
 *         </li>
 *     <li>To start the playback, {@link #start()} must be called. After
 *         {@link #start()} returns successfully, the MediaPlayer object is in the
 *         <em>Started</em> state. {@link #isPlaying()} can be called to test
 *         whether the MediaPlayer object is in the <em>Started</em> state.
 *         <ul>
 *         <li>While in the <em>Started</em> state, the internal player engine calls
 *         a user supplied OnBufferingUpdateListener.onBufferingUpdate() callback
 *         method if a OnBufferingUpdateListener has been registered beforehand
 *         via {@link #setOnBufferingUpdateListener(OnBufferingUpdateListener)}.
 *         This callback allows applications to keep track of the buffering status
 *         while streaming audio/video.</li>
 *         <li>Calling {@link #start()} has not effect
 *         on a MediaPlayer object that is already in the <em>Started</em> state.</li>
 *         </ul>
 *         </li>
 *     <li>Playback can be paused and stopped, and the current playback position
 *         can be adjusted. Playback can be paused via {@link #pause()}. When the call to
 *         {@link #pause()} returns, the MediaPlayer object enters the
 *         <em>Paused</em> state. Note that the transition from the <em>Started</em>
 *         state to the <em>Paused</em> state and vice versa happens
 *         asynchronously in the player engine. It may take some time before
 *         the state is updated in calls to {@link #isPlaying()}, and it can be
 *         a number of seconds in the case of streamed content.
 *         <ul>
 *         <li>Calling {@link #start()} to resume playback for a paused
 *         MediaPlayer object, and the resumed playback
 *         position is the same as where it was paused. When the call to
 *         {@link #start()} returns, the paused MediaPlayer object goes back to
 *         the <em>Started</em> state.</li>
 *         <li>Calling {@link #pause()} has no effect on
 *         a MediaPlayer object that is already in the <em>Paused</em> state.</li>
 *         </ul>
 *         </li>
 *     <li>Calling  {@link #stop()} stops playback and causes a
 *         MediaPlayer in the <em>Started</em>, <em>Paused</em>, <em>Prepared
 *         </em> or <em>PlaybackCompleted</em> state to enter the
 *         <em>Stopped</em> state.
 *         <ul>
 *         <li>Once in the <em>Stopped</em> state, playback cannot be started
 *         until {@link #prepare()} or {@link #prepareAsync()} are called to set
 *         the MediaPlayer object to the <em>Prepared</em> state again.</li>
 *         <li>Calling {@link #stop()} has no effect on a MediaPlayer
 *         object that is already in the <em>Stopped</em> state.</li>
 *         </ul>
 *         </li>
 *     <li>The playback position can be adjusted with a call to
 *         {@link #seekTo(int)}.
 *         <ul>
 *         <li>Although the asynchronuous {@link #seekTo(int)}
 *         call returns right way, the actual seek operation may take a while to
 *         finish, especially for audio/video being streamed. When the actual
 *         seek operation completes, the internal player engine calls a user
 *         supplied OnSeekComplete.onSeekComplete() if an OnSeekCompleteListener
 *         has been registered beforehand via
 *         {@link #setOnSeekCompleteListener(OnSeekCompleteListener)}.</li>
 *         <li>Please
 *         note that {@link #seekTo(int)} can also be called in the other states,
 *         such as <em>Prepared</em>, <em>Paused</em> and <em>PlaybackCompleted
 *         </em> state.</li>
 *         <li>Furthermore, the actual current playback position
 *         can be retrieved with a call to {@link #getCurrentPosition()}, which
 *         is helpful for applications such as a Music player that need to keep
 *         track of the playback progress.</li>
 *         </ul>
 *         </li>
 *     <li>When the playback reaches the end of stream, the playback completes.
 *         <ul>
 *         <li>If the looping mode was being set to <var>true</var>with
 *         {@link #setLooping(boolean)}, the MediaPlayer object shall remain in
 *         the <em>Started</em> state.</li>
 *         <li>If the looping mode was set to <var>false
 *         </var>, the player engine calls a user supplied callback method,
 *         OnCompletion.onCompletion(), if a OnCompletionListener is registered
 *         beforehand via {@link #setOnCompletionListener(OnCompletionListener)}.
 *         The invoke of the callback signals that the object is now in the <em>
 *         PlaybackCompleted</em> state.</li>
 *         <li>While in the <em>PlaybackCompleted</em>
 *         state, calling {@link #start()} can restart the playback from the
 *         beginning of the audio/video source.</li>
 * </ul>
