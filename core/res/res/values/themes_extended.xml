    This theme file includes empty stubs for the "Extended" themes. These
    by default are identical to their parent themes. Device overlays in
    the build tree should include an overlay for this file with appropriate
    enhancements for the device. Those defining the device-specific overlay can
    assume that any activity using an extended theme is also requesting
    hardware acceleration.
