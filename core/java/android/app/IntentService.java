/**
 * IntentService is an extension of the {@link Service} component class that
 * handles asynchronous requests (expressed as {@link Intent}s) on demand.
 * Clients send requests
 * through {@link android.content.Context#startService(Intent)} calls; the
 * service is started as needed, handles each Intent in turn using a worker
 * thread, and stops itself when it runs out of work.
 *
 * <p>This "work queue processor" pattern is commonly used to offload tasks
 * from an application's main thread.  The IntentService class exists to
 * simplify this pattern and take care of the mechanics.  To use it, extend
 * IntentService and implement {@link #onHandleIntent(Intent)}.  IntentService
 * will receive the Intents, launch a worker thread, and stop the service as
 * appropriate.
 *
 * <p>All requests are handled on a single worker thread -- they may take as
 * long as necessary (and will not block the application's main loop), but
 * only one request will be processed at a time.
 *
 * <div class="special reference">
 * <h3>Developer Guides</h3>

 *   imposed with Android 8.0 (API level 26). Consider using {@link androidx.work.WorkManager}
 *   or {@link androidx.core.app.JobIntentService}, which uses jobs
 *   instead of services when running on Android 8.0 or higher.
