<p>Contains the backup and restore functionality available to
applications. If a user wipes the data on their device or upgrades to a new Android-powered
device, all applications that have enabled backup will restore the user's previous data.</p>

<p>For a detailed guide to using the backup APIs, see the <a
href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/data/backup.html">Data Backup</a> developer guide.</p>
{@more}

<p>All backup and restore operations are controlled by the {@link
android.app.backup.BackupManager}. Each application that would
like to enable backup and preserve its data on remote strage must implement a
backup agent. A backup agent can be built by extending either {@link android.app.backup.BackupAgent}
or {@link android.app.backup.BackupAgentHelper}. The {@link
android.app.backup.BackupAgentHelper} class provides a wrapper around {@link
android.app.backup.BackupAgent} that simplifies the procedures to implement a backup agent by
employing backup helpers such as {@link android.app.backup.SharedPreferencesBackupHelper} and
{@link android.app.backup.FileBackupHelper}.</p>

<p>The backup APIs let applications:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Perform backup of arbitrary data to remote storage</li>
  <li>Easily perform backup of {@link android.content.SharedPreferences} and files</li>
  <li>Restore the data saved to remote storage</li>
</ul>
