     * be blocked and a candidate to be killed). You cannot launch a popup dialog

     * return a result to you asynchronously. If you need to perform any follow up

     * This does <em>not</em> change the expectation of being relatively
     * responsive to the broadcast, but does allow
     * the implementation to move work related to it over to another thread
     * to avoid glitching the main UI thread due to disk IO.
     *
     * <p>As a general rule, broadcast receivers are allowed to run for up to 10 seconds
     * before the system will consider them non-responsive and ANR the app.  Since these usually
     * execute on the app's main thread, they are already bound by the ~5 second time limit
     * of various operations that can happen there (not to mention just avoiding UI jank), so
     * the receive limit is generally not of concern.  However, once you use {@code goAsync}, though
     * able to be off the main thread, the broadcast execution limit still applies, and that
     * includes the time spent between calling this method and ultimately
     * {@link PendingResult#finish() PendingResult.finish()}.</p>
     *
     * <p>If you are taking advantage of this method to have more time to execute, it is useful
     * to know that the available time can be longer in certain situations.  In particular, if
     * the broadcast you are receiving is not a foreground broadcast (that is, the sender has not
     * used {@link Intent#FLAG_RECEIVER_FOREGROUND}), then more time is allowed for the receivers
     * to run, allowing them to execute for 30 seconds or even a bit more.  This is something that
     * receivers should rarely take advantage of (long work should be punted to another system
     * facility such as {@link android.app.job.JobScheduler}, {@link android.app.Service}, or
     * see especially {@link androidx.core.app.JobIntentService}), but can be useful in
     * certain rare cases where it is necessary to do some work as soon as the broadcast is
     * delivered.  Keep in mind that the work you do here will block further broadcasts until
     * it completes, so taking advantage of this at all excessively can be counter-productive
