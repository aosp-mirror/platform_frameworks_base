/**
 * This class provides a simple timing engine for running animations
 * which calculate animated values and set them on target objects.
 *
 * <p>There is a single timing pulse that all animations use. It runs in a
 * custom handler to ensure that property changes happen on the UI thread.</p>
 *
 * <p>By default, ValueAnimator uses non-linear time interpolation, via the
 * {@link AccelerateDecelerateInterpolator} class, which accelerates into and decelerates
 * out of an animation. This behavior can be changed by calling
 * {@link ValueAnimator#setInterpolator(TimeInterpolator)}.</p>
 *
 * <p>Animators can be created from either code or resource files. Here is an example
 * of a ValueAnimator resource file:</p>
 *
 * {@sample development/samples/ApiDemos/res/anim/animator.xml ValueAnimatorResources}
 *
 * <p>Starting from API 23, it is also possible to use a combination of {@link PropertyValuesHolder}
 * and {@link Keyframe} resource tags to create a multi-step animation.
 * Note that you can specify explicit fractional values (from 0 to 1) for
 * each keyframe to determine when, in the overall duration, the animation should arrive at that
 * value. Alternatively, you can leave the fractions off and the keyframes will be equally
 * distributed within the total duration:</p>
 *
 * {@sample development/samples/ApiDemos/res/anim/value_animator_pvh_kf.xml
 * ValueAnimatorKeyframeResources}
 *
 * <div class="special reference">
 * <h3>Developer Guides</h3>
 * <p>For more information about animating with {@code ValueAnimator}, read the
 * <a href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/graphics/prop-animation.html#value-animator">Property
 * Animation</a> developer guide.</p>

     * <ol>
     * <li>{@link #getAnimatedFraction()} is not needed (it will return undefined values).</li>
     * <li>The animator is immutable while {@link #isStarted()} is true. Requests
     *    to change values, duration, delay, etc... may be ignored.</li>
     * <li>Lifecycle callback events may be asynchronous. Events such as
     *    {@link Animator.AnimatorListener#onAnimationEnd(Animator)} or
     *    {@link Animator.AnimatorListener#onAnimationRepeat(Animator)} may end up delayed
     *    as they must be posted back to the UI thread, and any actions performed
     *    by those callbacks (such as starting new animations) will not happen
     *    in the same frame.</li>
     * <li>State change requests ({@link #cancel()}, {@link #end()}, {@link #reverse()}, etc...)
     *    may be asynchronous. It is guaranteed that all state changes that are
     *    performed on the UI thread in the same frame will be applied as a single
     *    atomic update, however that frame may be the current frame,
     *    the next frame, or some future frame. This will also impact the observed
     *    state of the Animator. For example, {@link #isStarted()} may still return true
     *    after a call to {@link #end()}. Using the lifecycle callbacks is preferred over
     *    queries to {@link #isStarted()}, {@link #isRunning()}, and {@link #isPaused()}
     *    for this reason.</li>
