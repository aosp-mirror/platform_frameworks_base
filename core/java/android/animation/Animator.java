     *    performed on the UI thread in the same frame will be applied as a single
     *    atomic update, however that frame may be the current frame,
     *    the next frame, or some future frame. This will also impact the observed
     *    state of the Animator. For example, {@link #isStarted()} may still return true
     *    after a call to {@link #end()}. Using the lifecycle callbacks is preferred over
     *    queries to {@link #isStarted()}, {@link #isRunning()}, and {@link #isPaused()}
