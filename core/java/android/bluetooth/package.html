<p>Provides classes that manage Bluetooth functionality, such as scanning for
devices, connecting with devices, and managing data transfer between devices.</p>

<p>For more information, see the
<a href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/connectivity/bluetooth.html">Bluetooth</a> guide.</p>
{@more}

<p>The Bluetooth APIs let applications:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Scan for other Bluetooth devices</li>
  <li>Query the local Bluetooth adapter for paired Bluetooth devices</li>
  <li>Establish RFCOMM channels/sockets</li>
  <li>Connect to specified sockets on other devices</li>
  <li>Transfer data to and from other devices</li>
</ul>

<p>
To perform Bluetooth communication using these APIs, an application must
declare the {@link android.Manifest.permission#BLUETOOTH} permission. Some
additional functionality, such as requesting device discovery,
also requires the {@link android.Manifest.permission#BLUETOOTH_ADMIN}
permission.
</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong>
Not all Android-powered devices provide Bluetooth functionality.</p>
