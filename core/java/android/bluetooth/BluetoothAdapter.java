 *
 * <p>To get a {@link BluetoothAdapter} representing the local Bluetooth

 * {@link #getBondedDevices()}; start device discovery with
 * {@link #startDiscovery()}; or create a {@link BluetoothServerSocket} to
 * listen for incoming connection requests with
 * {@link #listenUsingRfcommWithServiceRecord(String,UUID)}.
