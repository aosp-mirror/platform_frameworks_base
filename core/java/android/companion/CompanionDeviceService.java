/**
 * A service that receives calls from the system with device events.
 *
 * <p>
 * Companion applications must create a service that {@code extends}
 * {@link CompanionDeviceService}, and declare it in their AndroidManifest.xml with the
 * "android.permission.BIND_COMPANION_DEVICE_SERVICE" permission
 * (see {@link android.Manifest.permission#BIND_COMPANION_DEVICE_SERVICE}),
 * as well as add an intent filter for the "android.companion.CompanionDeviceService" action
 * (see {@link #SERVICE_INTERFACE}).
 *
 * <p>
 * Following is an example of such declaration:
 * <pre>{@code
 * <service
 *        android:name=".CompanionService"
 *        android:label="@string/service_name"
 *        android:exported="true"
 *        android:permission="android.permission.BIND_COMPANION_DEVICE_SERVICE">
 *    <intent-filter>
 *        <action android:name="android.companion.CompanionDeviceService" />
 *    </intent-filter>
 * </service>
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * If the companion application has requested observing device presence (see
 * {@link CompanionDeviceManager#startObservingDevicePresence(String)}) the system will
 * <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/components/bound-services"> bind the service</a>
 * when it detects the device nearby (for BLE devices) or when the device is connected
 * (for Bluetooth devices).
 *
 * <p>
 * The system binding {@link CompanionDeviceService} elevates the priority of the process that
 * the service is running in, and thus may prevent
 * <a href="https://developer.android.com/topic/performance/memory-management#low-memory_killer">
 * the Low-memory killer</a> from killing the process at expense of other processes with lower
 * priority.
 *
 * <p>
 * It is possible for an application to declare multiple {@link CompanionDeviceService}-s.
 * In such case, the system will bind all declared services, but will deliver
 * {@link #onDeviceAppeared(AssociationInfo)} and {@link #onDeviceDisappeared(AssociationInfo)}
 * only to one "primary" services.
 * Applications that declare multiple {@link CompanionDeviceService}-s should indicate the "primary"
 * service using "android.companion.PROPERTY_PRIMARY_COMPANION_DEVICE_SERVICE" service level
 * property.
 * <pre>{@code
 * <property
 *       android:name="android.companion.PROPERTY_PRIMARY_COMPANION_DEVICE_SERVICE"
 *       android:value="true" />
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * If the application declares multiple {@link CompanionDeviceService}-s, but does not indicate
 * the "primary" one, the system will pick one of the declared services to use as "primary".
 *
 * <p>
 * If the application declares multiple "primary" {@link CompanionDeviceService}-s, the system
 * will pick single one of them to use as "primary".
