/**
 * Parallel implementation of certain VirtualDeviceManager APIs that need to be exposed to native
 * code.
 *
 * <p>These APIs are a parallel definition to the APIs in VirtualDeviceManager and/or
 * VirtualDeviceManagerInternal, so they can technically diverge. However, it's good practice to
 * keep these APIs in sync with each other.</p>
 *
 * <p>Even though the name implies otherwise, the implementation is actually in Java. The 'native'
 * suffix comes from the intended usage - native framework backends that need to communicate with
 * VDM for some reason.</p>
 *
 * <p>Because these APIs are exposed to native code that runs in the app process, they may be
 * accessed by apps directly, even though they're hidden. Care should be taken to avoid exposing
 * sensitive data or potential security holes.</p>
