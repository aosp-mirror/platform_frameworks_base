     * writable by the app and not already have fs-verity enabled, and the file must not currently

     * perform a signature check by itself before using the file. The signature is often delivered
     * as a separate file and stored next to the targeting file in the filesystem. The public key of
     * the signer (normally the same app developer) can be put in the APK, and the app can use the
     * public key to verify the signature to the file's actual fs-verity digest (from {@link
     * #getFsVerityDigest(File)}) before using the file. The exact format is not prescribed by the
     * framework. App developers may choose to use common practices like JCA for the signing and
     * verification, or their own preferred approach.
