     * Verifies that {@code attestation} describes a computing environment that meets the
     * requirements of {@code profile}, {@code localBindingType}, and {@code requirements}.
     *
     * <p>This method verifies that at least one system-registered {@linkplain
     * AttestationVerificationService attestation verifier} associated with {@code profile} and
     * {@code localBindingType} has verified that {@code attestation} attests that the remote
     * environment matching the local binding data (determined by {@code localBindingType}) in
     * {@code requirements} meets the requirements of the profile.
     *
     * <p>For successful verification, the {@code requirements} bundle must contain locally-known
     * data which must match {@code attestation}. The required data in the bundle is defined by the
     * {@code localBindingType} (see documentation for the type). Verifiers will fail to verify the
     * attestation if the bundle contains unsupported data.
     *
     * <p>The {@code localBindingType} specifies how {@code attestation} is bound to a local
     * secure channel endpoint or similar connection with the target remote environment described by
     * the attestation. The binding is expected to be related to a cryptographic protocol, and each
     * binding type requires specific arguments to be present in the {@code requirements} bundle. It
     * is this binding to something known locally that ensures an attestation is not only valid, but
     * is also associated with a particular connection.
     *
     * <p>The {@code callback} is called with a result and {@link VerificationToken} (which may be
     * null). The result is an integer (see constants in {@link VerificationResultFlags}).
     *
     * <p>It's expected that a verifier will be able to decode and understand the passed values,
     * otherwise fail to verify. {@code attestation} should contain some type data to prevent parse
     * errors.
     *
     * <p>The values put into the {@code requirements} Bundle depend on the {@code
     * localBindingType} used.
     *
     * @param profile          the attestation profile which defines the security requirements which
     *                         must be met by the environment described by {@code attestation}
     * @param localBindingType the type of the local binding data; see constants in this class with
     *                         the prefix {@code TYPE_}
