/**
 * Object used to report key and button events.
 * <p>
 * Each key press is described by a sequence of key events.  A key press
 * starts with a key event with {@link #ACTION_DOWN}.  If the key is held
 * sufficiently long that it repeats, then the initial down is followed
 * additional key events with {@link #ACTION_DOWN} and a non-zero value for
 * {@link #getRepeatCount()}.  The last key event is a {@link #ACTION_UP}
 * for the key up.  If the key press is canceled, the key up event will have the
 * {@link #FLAG_CANCELED} flag set.
 * </p><p>
 * Key events are generally accompanied by a key code ({@link #getKeyCode()}),
 * scan code ({@link #getScanCode()}) and meta state ({@link #getMetaState()}).
 * Key code constants are defined in this class.  Scan code constants are raw
 * device-specific codes obtained from the OS and so are not generally meaningful
 * to applications unless interpreted using the {@link KeyCharacterMap}.
 * Meta states describe the pressed state of key modifiers
 * such as {@link #META_SHIFT_ON} or {@link #META_ALT_ON}.
 * </p><p>
 * Key codes typically correspond one-to-one with individual keys on an input device.
 * Many keys and key combinations serve quite different functions on different
 * input devices so care must be taken when interpreting them.  Always use the
 * {@link KeyCharacterMap} associated with the input device when mapping keys
 * to characters.  Be aware that there may be multiple key input devices active
 * at the same time and each will have its own key character map.
 * </p><p>
 * As soft input methods can use multiple and inventive ways of inputting text,
 * there is no guarantee that any key press on a soft keyboard will generate a key
 * event: this is left to the IME's discretion, and in fact sending such events is
 * discouraged.  You should never rely on receiving KeyEvents for any key on a soft
 * input method.  In particular, the default software keyboard will never send any
 * key event to any application targetting Jelly Bean or later, and will only send
 * events for some presses of the delete and return keys to applications targetting
 * Ice Cream Sandwich or earlier.  Be aware that other software input methods may
 * never send key events regardless of the version.  Consider using editor actions
 * like {@link android.view.inputmethod.EditorInfo#IME_ACTION_DONE} if you need
 * specific interaction with the software keyboard, as it gives more visibility to
 * the user as to how your application will react to key presses.
 * </p><p>
 * When interacting with an IME, the framework may deliver key events
 * with the special action {@link #ACTION_MULTIPLE} that either specifies
 * that single repeated key code or a sequence of characters to insert.
 * </p><p>
 * In general, the framework cannot guarantee that the key events it delivers
 * to a view always constitute complete key sequences since some events may be dropped
 * or modified by containing views before they are delivered.  The view implementation
 * should be prepared to handle {@link #FLAG_CANCELED} and should tolerate anomalous
 * situations such as receiving a new {@link #ACTION_DOWN} without first having
 * received an {@link #ACTION_UP} for the prior key press.
 * </p><p>
 * Refer to {@link InputDevice} for more information about how different kinds of
 * input devices and sources represent keys and buttons.
 * </p>
