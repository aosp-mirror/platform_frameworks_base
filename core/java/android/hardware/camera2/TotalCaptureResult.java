/**
 * <p>The total assembled results of a single image capture from the image sensor.</p>
 *
 * <p>Contains the final configuration for the capture hardware (sensor, lens,
 * flash), the processing pipeline, the control algorithms, and the output
 * buffers.</p>
 *
 * <p>A {@code TotalCaptureResult} is produced by a {@link CameraDevice} after processing a
 * {@link CaptureRequest}. All properties listed for capture requests can also
 * be queried on the capture result, to determine the final values used for
 * capture. The result also includes additional metadata about the state of the
 * camera device during the capture.</p>
 *
 * <p>All properties returned by {@link CameraCharacteristics#getAvailableCaptureResultKeys()}
 * are available (that is {@link CaptureResult#get} will return non-{@code null}, if and only if
 * that key that was enabled by the request. A few keys such as
 * {@link CaptureResult#STATISTICS_FACES} are disabled by default unless enabled with a switch (such
 * as {@link CaptureRequest#STATISTICS_FACE_DETECT_MODE}). Refer to each key documentation on
 * a case-by-case basis.</p>
 *
 * <p>For a logical multi-camera device, if the CaptureRequest contains a surface for an underlying
 * physical camera, the corresponding {@link TotalCaptureResult} object will include the metadata
 * for that physical camera. And the mapping between the physical camera id and result metadata
 * can be accessed via {@link #getPhysicalCameraResults}. If all requested surfaces are for the
 * logical camera, no metadata for physical camera will be included.</p>
 *
 * <p>{@link TotalCaptureResult} objects are immutable.</p>
