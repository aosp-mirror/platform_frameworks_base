/**
 * A cache that holds strong references to a limited number of values. Each time
 * a value is accessed, it is moved to the head of a queue. When a value is
 * added to a full cache, the value at the end of that queue is evicted and may
 * become eligible for garbage collection.
 *
 * <p>If your cached values hold resources that need to be explicitly released,
 * override {@link #entryRemoved}.
 *
 * <p>If a cache miss should be computed on demand for the corresponding keys,
 * override {@link #create}. This simplifies the calling code, allowing it to
 * assume a value will always be returned, even when there's a cache miss.
 *
 * <p>By default, the cache size is measured in the number of entries. Override
 * {@link #sizeOf} to size the cache in different units. For example, this cache
 * is limited to 4MiB of bitmaps:
 * <pre>   {@code
 *   int cacheSize = 4 * 1024 * 1024; // 4MiB
 *   LruCache<String, Bitmap> bitmapCache = new LruCache<String, Bitmap>(cacheSize) {
 *       protected int sizeOf(String key, Bitmap value) {
 *           return value.getByteCount();
 *       }
 *   }}</pre>
 *
 * <p>This class is thread-safe. Perform multiple cache operations atomically by
 * synchronizing on the cache: <pre>   {@code
 *   synchronized (cache) {
 *     if (cache.get(key) == null) {
 *         cache.put(key, value);
 *     }
 *   }}</pre>
 *
 * <p>This class does not allow null to be used as a key or value. A return
 * value of null from {@link #get}, {@link #put} or {@link #remove} is
 * unambiguous: the key was not in the cache.
 *
 * <p>This class appeared in Android 3.1 (Honeycomb MR1); it's available as part
 * of <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/compatibility-library.html">Android's
 * Support Package</a> for earlier releases.
