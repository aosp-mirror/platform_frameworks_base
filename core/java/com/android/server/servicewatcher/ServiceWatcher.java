/**
 * A ServiceWatcher is responsible for continuously maintaining an active binding to a service
 * selected by it's {@link ServiceSupplier}. The {@link ServiceSupplier} may change the service it
 * selects over time, and the currently bound service may crash, restart, have a user change, have
 * changes made to its package, and so on and so forth. The ServiceWatcher is responsible for
 * maintaining the binding across all these changes.
 *
 * <p>Clients may invoke {@link BinderOperation}s on the ServiceWatcher, and it will make a best
 * effort to run these on the currently bound service, but individual operations may fail (if there
 * is no service currently bound for instance). In order to help clients maintain the correct state,
 * clients may supply a {@link ServiceListener}, which is informed when the ServiceWatcher connects
 * and disconnects from a service. This allows clients to bring a bound service back into a known
 * state on connection, and then run binder operations from there. In order to help clients
 * accomplish this, ServiceWatcher guarantees that {@link BinderOperation}s and the
 * {@link ServiceListener} will always be run on the same thread, so that strong ordering guarantees
 * can be established between them.
 *
 * There is never any guarantee of whether a ServiceWatcher is currently connected to a service, and
 * whether any particular {@link BinderOperation} will succeed. Clients must ensure they do not rely
 * on this, and instead use {@link ServiceListener} notifications as necessary to recover from
 * failures.
